{'prompt': 'wow, you scared the living daylights out of me!', 'completion': 'Hoo hoo hoo!'}
{'prompt': 'well, i guess it was a really great prank. good one nanna.. anyway, are you REALLY my dead nanna?', 'completion': 'Of course, John! I have come back to help you on your journey through <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Medium'}
{'prompt': 'what? ok, so what is the medium you are talking about?', 'completion': 'It is where we are now! A realm that is a ring of pure void, dividing light and darkness. It turns in the thick of <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Incipisphere'}
{'prompt': 'you mean because we are inside a computer, or in the game software or something?', 'completion': 'A computer? Why, what is that, dear? Some new fangled contraption, like the horseless auto-boxcar?'}
{'prompt': "well, uh, it's like this machine that, uh...", 'completion': 'Hoo hoo hoo! Of course I know what a computer is, John! I was just pulling your leg! Hoo hoo hoo!'}
{'prompt': 'oh, ok.', 'completion': "No, John. You are not inside a computer or software or anything like that! Try not to be so linear, dear. The software that brought you here was merely a mechanism that served as a gateway! Its routines in a way served to invoke this realm's instance, yet it stands independently of any physical machine, and somewhat paradoxically, always has!"}
{'prompt': "i'm not sure i get it, but alright.. so what do i actually need to be doing here?", 'completion': 'I think it would be best if we started with the big picture!'}
{'prompt': 'whoa!!!', 'completion': 'For now, your objective is to proceed towards <span style="text-decoration: underline">Skaia'}
{'prompt': 'how am i supposed to get up there?', 'completion': 'You build!'}
{'prompt': 'and then after that, we solve this ultimate riddle thing and save earth from destruction!!!', 'completion': "Oh no, I'm afraid not!"}
{'prompt': 'and that is?', 'completion': 'HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!'}
{'prompt': 'hooray!', 'completion': 'I am going to go bake you some cookies.'}
{'prompt': 'ok nanna, i will.. hey, nanna?', 'completion': 'Yes, dear?'}
{'prompt': "since i am trying to get up to that gate, and since you can sort of conjure floating beds and throw me around and all.... couldn't you just throw me up to the gate?", 'completion': 'Yes, of course, John!. But that would not serve your purpose well!. There is a very good reason why you should build up to it. And then keep building!'}
{'prompt': "oh, ok, i guess that's what i figured.. so just one more thing.... do you think that instead of telling me exactly why that is with a clear explanation, you can give me a series of really coy riddles about it and then sort of giggle?", 'completion': 'John, you are a very fresh young man!. Your father has done such a wonderful job raising you. I am so proud of you both.'}
{'prompt': 'ha ha, i guess.', 'completion': 'When you pass through the first gate, everything will change. You will find the place where the constellations dance beneath the clouds. And then your true work may begin.. Hoo hoo hoo!'}
