{'prompt': 'thank you', 'completion': "jk haha.. no, i don't have it yet.. my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.. and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.. it's so frustrating."}
{'prompt': 'whats your modus', 'completion': 'what?'}
{'prompt': 'how do you retrieve artifacts from it', 'completion': 'oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out.'}
{'prompt': 'stack?? hahahahahaha', 'completion': 'what is yours?'}
{'prompt': 'hash map. my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome', 'completion': 'what the hell is that?'}
{'prompt': 'you should probably brush up on your data structures', 'completion': 'i guess.'}
{'prompt': 'did you at least allocate your strife specibus', 'completion': 'no.'}
{'prompt': 'it could free up a card for you. plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle. which is never. what have you got', 'completion': "well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms."}
{'prompt': 'wow you really suck at this dont you. just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus', 'completion': 'how?'}
{'prompt': 'hammerkind?', 'completion': 'yeah.'}
{'prompt': 'ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus. i guess i should have mentioned that', 'completion': 'uh...'}
{'prompt': 'hope you like hammers dude!', 'completion': "yeah, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant."}
{'prompt': 'I understand you have recently come into possession of the beta release of "The Game of the Year", as featured in respectable periodicals such as GameBro Magazine.', 'completion': "that's an ugly rumor.. whoever told you that is a filthy liar.. and you should probably stop hitting on him all the time or whatever."}
{'prompt': "I can't control myself.. I must have a weakness for insufferable pricks.", 'completion': "anyway i still haven't checked the mail, my dad has it.. i'm trying to go get it from him, so brb"}
{'prompt': 'John.', 'completion': 'what?'}
{'prompt': "You're wearing one of your disguises now, aren't you?. You are typing to me right now while wearing something ridiculous.", 'completion': "no, why would you even think that??. that's so stupid."}
{'prompt': "Ok.. Why don't you go get the game from your father?", 'completion': 'alright, wish me luck.. oh, btw.... jk I was wearing a funny disguise this whole time.. gotcha! hehehehe'}
{'prompt': "It looks like you managed to retrieve the beta. Excellent.. I'm going to try to connect.", 'completion': 'whoa ok but i just got the most awesome present.'}
{'prompt': 'The rabbit?', 'completion': 'SO SWEET.'}
{'prompt': "I've heard tales of this wretched creature often. Its Homeric legend is practically ensconced in the fold of my personal mythology by now.", 'completion': 'ha ha, what?'}
{'prompt': "Why don't we focus on the matter at hand?", 'completion': "oh the game, ok.. i don't really know how this works. what am i even looking at here?"}
{'prompt': 'You are running the client application. I am running the server, so I am the host user. I have established a connection with you. This is sufficient for us to play the game.', 'completion': 'oh, ok then.'}
{'prompt': "Sorry. I'm just getting a feel for the controls.", 'completion': 'is my magic chest on the roof now??'}
{'prompt': 'Yes.', 'completion': ''}
{'prompt': "I'll give it a shot.", 'completion': 'thx!'}
{'prompt': 'No luck.. It appears to be out of range. I\'m guessing it is too far away from you, the "player".', 'completion': ''}
{'prompt': 'It seems expanding the dimensions of your room cost us some "Build Grist".. But deploying the lathe did not appear to incur any expense.. It looks like certain objects are freebies, probably to help you set up the game.', 'completion': 'wow, ok.. what do they do?'}
{'prompt': "I think it's up to you to find out.. All I can do is drop stuff in your house, and move it around, apparently.", 'completion': 'how do i move stuff around? it sounds fun!'}
{'prompt': "I don't think you can as the client. You will need to install the server application.. You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.", 'completion': 'what??'}
{'prompt': 'Did you get another envelope in the mail?', 'completion': 'no!'}
{'prompt': "Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.. Are you sure you didn't get it?", 'completion': 'oh man.. i think i might know where it is.'}
{'prompt': "Now that your room is bigger, why don't you move to the far corner?. It will extend the range of the cursor, and I can reach the items.. Which... you threw out the window for some reason?", 'completion': 'good idea!'}
{'prompt': 'What have you been doing in here all afternoon, anyway?', 'completion': 'ugh, i was fussing with my retarded sylladex.. but i think i have it under control now.. what modus do you use?'}
{'prompt': 'I like to use trees.', 'completion': 'oh no, that sounds so awkward.'}
{'prompt': 'Yes. Two more large gizmos.', 'completion': 'sweet!. what is with all these big contraptions?'}
{'prompt': 'If I had to guess, they appear to facilitate a sort of system involving punch card-based alchemy.', 'completion': 'huh.. to what end?. i mean what are we supposed to be doing in this game?'}
{'prompt': 'The one you threw into the yard?', 'completion': 'no, i am telling you.. it jumped out of my sylladex like a frightened weasel.'}
{'prompt': 'What were you doing with it in the first place?. I am not sensing a lot of regard for the personal property of others.. Is this how your pent-up frustration with your father manifests itself?', 'completion': 'what? no.. those were all accidents.. please take your psycho-babblery elsewhere, miss!'}
{'prompt': 'Your bathroom is a mess.. Did you do that too?', 'completion': "oh man, see this isn't cool.. all this snooping nonsense!"}
{'prompt': "There's a cake in the toilet.", 'completion': 'yes. there is.'}
{'prompt': "I'm tempted to clean it up for you.", 'completion': 'ok, if that will satisfy your weird ocd complex then go ahead.'}
{'prompt': 'My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder complex?. Can a disorder also be a complex?', 'completion': 'in your case, probably!'}
{'prompt': 'Sounds complicated.', 'completion': 'anyway.... i am going to have a look at this enormous platformy thing you put on the balcony.'}
{'prompt': 'Whoops.', 'completion': 'whoops what?'}
{'prompt': "I think I can patch it up.. Just give me a little space.. Why don't you go have a look at the Cruxtruder?", 'completion': 'the what?'}
{'prompt': 'john did you get my package??', 'completion': 'oh hey!. no, not yet.'}
{'prompt': 'darn! are you sure? it was in a green box.....', 'completion': "oh!. yes, but it is in my dad's car and he is still out at the store.. he should be back soon."}
{'prompt': 'great!!! so what are you up to today?', 'completion': 'i am up to my neck in this sburb stuff.. TT is making a royal mess of my house.'}
{'prompt': 'lol!. whats sburb??', 'completion': "oh, it is this game.. it's ok i guess. i'm still figuring it out."}
{'prompt': 'whoa what was that?????', 'completion': 'what was what?'}
{'prompt': 'there was a loud noise outside my house!!. it sounded like an explosion!!!!', 'completion': 'wow, really?'}
{'prompt': 'i will go outside and look....', 'completion': 'oh man, alright but be careful, ok?'}
{'prompt': "There's a door there?", 'completion': 'um, YEAH???'}
{'prompt': "I didn't see it.. I just thought it fit nicely into that groove.", 'completion': 'you mean you thought it was elegant?. ok well what do i do with this thing.. hello?. what are you doing up there now?'}
{'prompt': "Sorry. I keep losing the wireless signal.. Must be the weather.. I would look for a stronger signal in another part of the house, but I'd rather not risk an encounter with my mother.. I battled through her cloud of gin and derision once already this evening.", 'completion': 'haha, yeah I hear you.'}
{'prompt': "Yes. Cake, jesters, unfaltering love and support.. Quite a road to hoe there.. Though I suppose I'm complicit for not informing Social Services about your situation.", 'completion': "i know!. what about going outside?. maybe you could catch a neighbor's signal."}
{'prompt': "That presents the same problem.. Also, it's raining, remember?. And dark.", 'completion': "It's dark already?"}
{'prompt': 'Yes, the sun has already had its way with us here on the east coast.. Its lurid glare has moved on to younger timezones.', 'completion': 'haha, um, ok.'}
{'prompt': "I've been looking at the GameFAQ walkthroughs to figure some of this stuff out.. Hold while I read further.", 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': 'All of these walkthroughs are extremely short.. None progress much further than this point.', 'completion': 'weird.. well, i mean it is a new game.'}
{'prompt': 'That is probably the "Kernelsprite".. It apparently needs to be "prototyped".. Twice, actually.. Whatever the hell that means.. These walkthroughs are horrendously written.', 'completion': 'hmm, ok.. well, you are the one with the cursor so just do whatever you think is the right thing to do!. also, fix my bathroom.'}
{'prompt': 'That was only "Tier One Prototyping".. There is still another tier to the prototyping process.. Which for all we know merely advances this entity through increasingly esoteric states of linguistics.', 'completion': "the clock is ticking.. we don't have time for this asinine tomfoolery."}
{'prompt': 'This unmitigated poppycock?', 'completion': "extravagant hogwash!. ok stop. stop typing whatever silly thing you're typing.. i'm going upstairs to the big platformy thing."}
{'prompt': 'The alchemiter?', 'completion': '??'}
{'prompt': "I'm back.", 'completion': "hurry up and open my door!!!!!!. not that it even matters, i think i'm probably dead no matter what!!!!!!"}
{'prompt': "Patience. You still haven't used the new totem.", 'completion': '???'}
{'prompt': 'I believe it will create the item on the punch card.', 'completion': 'so what is it, like an apple or something?. what good will that even do?'}
{'prompt': 'We\'ll see.. I\'ve found no evidence that anyone has successfully created the item.. And the content of the card appears to be variable from session to session.. In one instance it was described as an "eggy loking thign" [sic].', 'completion': 'do we have enough of those building jewels to make it?'}
{'prompt': 'John?. Are you there?', 'completion': "hey, yeah i'm here!. and not dead i think."}
{'prompt': "I know.. I've been watching you scramble through the house like a lunatic.. You should have answered me sooner.", 'completion': "oh man, sorry, i was looking around for my dad and i can't find him anywhere!. have you seen him?"}
{'prompt': "No. I'm sure he'll turn up.. We have more important things to address right now.", 'completion': 'yeah, like where am i??'}
{'prompt': "I don't know that either. But I've determined your neighborhood was destroyed by the meteor. Wherever you were transported, it saved you from the impact.. I've been reading reports in the news. Over the last few days, there have been many smaller meteor collisions with people's homes around the world.. And they seem to be getting bigger. Yours was the biggest they've identified so far.", 'completion': "wow, ok.. so then i guess if this is all the game's doing, then the point is for us to save the world?"}
{'prompt': 'Perhaps.', 'completion': "then we'd better get moving and figure this game out!!!"}
{'prompt': 'Yes, but wait.. We should retrieve your PDA. Yet again.. It will help to keep tabs on each other while you investigate.. I think I can get you closer to it, if I can replenish our grist supply somewhat.. There may be a way to recycle some that we already used.', 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': "I'll meet you out on the balcony.", 'completion': 'wait, rose! one thing...'}
{'prompt': 'What?', 'completion': 'you never even wished me a happy birthday!. um... hello?'}
{'prompt': "I was working on something to send you, but I was running late with it.. I didn't want you to think I believed meager well wishes alone would suffice for the occasion.. That said, happy birthday, John.", 'completion': 'haha, oh jeez, that is silly!. anyway, thanks!'}
{'prompt': 'John, are you ok?. You seem a bit tentative.', 'completion': "i'm fine i guess.. since i got here i feel compelled to do these weird things i don't really want to do.. by some kind of voice that i can't really even hear. i don't know, it is hard to explain."}
{'prompt': 'Perhaps the early symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like post-traumatic stress?', 'completion': 'yeah, maybe. who knows!'}
{'prompt': "Well, if you can pull yourself together, there are a few more things we should try.. Like prototyping the Kernelsprite again, if possible.. We should hurry. My laptop battery won't last forever.", 'completion': 'Ok. I will go back inside.'}
{'prompt': "We have to hurry along. I'm running low on battery power.", 'completion': "but the cake mix... ugh, that's so dumb."}
{'prompt': 'I doubt it matters.. We might as well just use any old crap lying around.', 'completion': 'fine.. i GUESS.'}
{'prompt': "I can't find it anywhere in the house.. No time to worry about it.. The next thing we should do is get your server copy of the game from the car.. You need to connect to my client, so I can repeat your steps and presumably join you, wherever you are.. We should do this quickly, before my house burns down.", 'completion': "what, there's a fire??"}
{'prompt': 'There will be soon.', 'completion': 'oh jeez!. so move this thing already!'}
{'prompt': "It looks like it requires a lot of grist to move.. I don't have enough to relocate the door, either.", 'completion': 'how much do you have?'}
{'prompt': 'Zero.', 'completion': 'oh.. hmm.. i thought about jumping to the car from the ledge earlier but that sounds really dangerous!'}
{'prompt': 'come on this is hells of ill just listen', 'completion': "it sounds like you don't even believe me that i was about to get blown up!. but i really was, but now im in some weird dimension that sburb sent me to or something.. and now on top of that i think i'm being haunted by my dead grandma!"}
{'prompt': 'huh. for real', 'completion': "yeah, it's true but i'll talk to you later about it!"}
{'prompt': 'i think i could drop some sick rhymes about all this', 'completion': "man, see i just don't think all the rapping stuff is really as cool as you think it is."}
{'prompt': 'no thisll be dope check it', 'completion': 'no, i have to go! bye!'}
{'prompt': "I'm lifting the car up to the balcony.", 'completion': 'whoa, ok.'}
{'prompt': "Once it is up, retrieve the game. Then I'll put it back down on the driveway.", 'completion': 'but the door is locked!'}
{'prompt': 'Then break a window.', 'completion': "but it's my dad's car"}
{'prompt': "It's just a window, and this is sort of an emergency.. Otherwise I promise I'll handle the car with velvet gloves.", 'completion': 'alright.'}
{'prompt': 'im back!', 'completion': 'oh hi!'}
{'prompt': 'i went to investigate the explosion i heard', 'completion': 'was it by any chance a meteor?'}
{'prompt': 'yes!!!!!. how did you know??', 'completion': "oh man, it's kind of a long story!. anyway, are you ok? did it blow up your yard or start a fire or anything?"}
{'prompt': 'no i am fine!. it landed a pretty good ways from my house and i went to look at it. and its pretty big!. but bec doesnt want me to go near it. so i came home. he seems to think its dangerous!', 'completion': "well gosh, he's probably right!"}
{'prompt': 'anyway what have you been up to john?. oh!!!! did you get my package yet?', 'completion': 'er.... yeah, i was trying to get it, but rose dropped my car into a weird spooky bottomless pit and the package was in the car and im really sorry about that.'}
{'prompt': 'oh no!', 'completion': 'wow, ok, i guess i should start at the beginning.. see, a meteor blew up my neighborhood.'}
{'prompt': 'thats terrible john! im so sorry!', 'completion': "but i'm ok! and my house is too, sort of.. that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose, sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.. but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the world from the apocalypse!!!"}
{'prompt': 'O_O. well...... it sounds really crazy and kind of scary but...... it also sounds kind of exciting!. i dont know john maybe this is your destiny. if anyone can save the world i think it is probably you!', 'completion': 'wow, you think so?'}
{'prompt': 'yes!', 'completion': "well ok, BUT.. it's not even that simple!. i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from meteors and fire and stuff.. but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!. so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!. but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff."}
{'prompt': 'hahaha. he is so silly!', 'completion': 'yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.'}
{'prompt': 'cant explain to me why this aint condescension to think ill shit a brick. not even he can convey the intention with his quickspun wit. rather defray all this tension, sit on his lap while he whittles a splint. and some guy eyes what he does and patronizes', 'completion': "stop rapping for a second you horse's ass!. i have something important to talk about."}
{'prompt': 'whats up', 'completion': 'rose is in trouble and she needs help. i was going to connect to her with sburb but i lost my copy!'}
{'prompt': 'ok', 'completion': "also she lost battery power. if she can get back up and running, she'll need someone with the game to get her out of there before her house burns down.. so i think you should use your copy of the game to help her!"}
{'prompt': 'my copy?. thats going to be tough', 'completion': 'why?'}
{'prompt': 'i lost it. its a stupid story and id rather not talk about it. shit be embarrassing yo', 'completion': 'i thought you said you had two?'}
{'prompt': 'well yeah. one is my brothers copy', 'completion': 'ok, well get his then!'}
{'prompt': 'alright. but hes not gonna be happy about that', 'completion': "whatever.. also you might want to read rose's walkthrough to get up to speed on this."}
{'prompt': 'oh man', 'completion': 'what?'}
{'prompt': 'nothing really. look all im saying is the girl tends to lay it on kinda thick you know?', 'completion': '/ROLLS EYES'}
{'prompt': 'oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here', 'completion': 'ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?'}
{'prompt': 'but. the seal on the bottle is unbroken. are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory', 'completion': "all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?. try using your brain numbnuts."}
{'prompt': 'why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like. i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous', 'completion': 'it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.'}
{'prompt': 'ok i can accept that. monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters. also fred savage has a really punchable face. but who cares about this lets stop talking about it. did you get the beta yet', 'completion': 'no.. did you?'}
{'prompt': 'man i got two copies already. but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring. did you see how it got slammed in game bro????', 'completion': 'game bro is a joke and we both know it.'}
{'prompt': 'yeah. why dont you go check your mail maybe its there now', 'completion': 'alright.'}
{'prompt': 'well if she comes back ill be ready. you better know what youre talking about cause this could get ugly. brought my phone and i also took my awesome katana with me in case things get too hot to handle. and they always do', 'completion': 'you mean that cheap piece of shit you have on your wall?'}
{'prompt': 'FU. its sharp and its awesome and its a sword. end of story', 'completion': "ok i don't really care.. i'm in my room again, i really think there's someone else in this house.. like monsters or something."}
{'prompt': 'howie???', 'completion': 'haha I WISH.'}
{'prompt': 'dude monsters arent real. thats stupid kids stuff for stupid babies', 'completion': "maybe. yeah you're right."}
{'prompt': 'what are you an idiot. of course there are monsters in your house. youre in some weird evil monster dimension come on. skepticism is the crutch of cinematic troglodytes. like hey mom dad theres a dinosaur or a ghost or whatever in my room. "yeah right junior go back to bed". fuck you mom and dad how many times are we going to watch this trope unfold it wasnt goddamn funny the first time i saw it. just once id like to see dad crap his pants when a kid says theres a vampire in his closet. "OH SHIT EVERYONE IN THE MINIVAN". be fuckin dad of the year right there', 'completion': 'ok ok stop!. what do i do?'}
{'prompt': 'what do you have a hammer. man so lame. ok whatever. you should look into weaponizing your sylladex. my bro is always getting on my case about it but man its not as easy as it sounds. but if youre fighting monsters left and right you dont have much choice', 'completion': "hmm.... ok, i guess i can read up on data structures some more.. how's it going there?"}
{'prompt': 'im out in the living room hes usually here. but i dont see him. might be playing his mind games hes always pulling this ninja shit. all i see is lil cal over there so i guess he cant be far', 'completion': 'hahaha.. oh god.. SO LAME.'}
{'prompt': 'what', 'completion': "see.... i just don't know why you think it's cool.. his ventriloquist rapping thing."}
{'prompt': 'oh lil cal? no man. lil cal is the shit', 'completion': "that's fine, you are entitled to your opinion, i am just saying that being a white guy who is a rapper with a ventriloquist doll is not cool by any stretch of the imagination or by any definition of word cool, ironic or otherwise. that's all i'm saying."}
{'prompt': 'yeah bullshit. cal is dope. puppets are awesome. john egbert blows. the end', 'completion': "yeah, more like the opposite of all those things is the thing that is true!. i'm going to read.. good luck with your bro."}
{'prompt': 'Oh, there you are.', 'completion': "oh, yeah.. sorry!. i'm not sure what came over me there, i was acting really crazy for some reason.. but my head feels like it's clearing up, i think i'm alright now."}
{'prompt': "Sorry.. No nuance to these controls at all.. I was hoping to bludgeon the imp without letting go of it. Guess I can't really do that.. A broken piano isn't the end of the world though.", 'completion': "i guess you're right."}
{'prompt': "You'll need to pick up the spoils in person. I can't interact with the grist.", 'completion': 'so.... that means i have to go out the back door?'}
{'prompt': 'Yes. Is there a problem?', 'completion': 'well it may sound dumb, but i was hoping to avoid nanna and her spooky ghost cookies.'}
{'prompt': "You're right, that does sound dumb.", 'completion': 'can you see her in the kitchen?'}
{'prompt': 'Yeah.', 'completion': "what's she doing, is she baking?"}
{'prompt': 'You could say that.', 'completion': "are you SURE you can't get that grist up to me somehow?"}
{'prompt': "There you go.. Now why don't you check out the Designix?. You can do that while I get to work.", 'completion': 'on what?'}
{'prompt': "Nanna said to build, so that's what I'm doing.", 'completion': 'oh yeah. ok.'}
{'prompt': "But this sure is going to take a lot of grist.. Looks like you're going to be busy, John.", 'completion': 'blargh!. well, what are you building?'}
{'prompt': 'Stairs.. They are fairly expensive actually.', 'completion': 'oh man.... i could have warned you about stairs, rose!'}
{'prompt': "I'll try recouping some of the grist from the catwalk I built earlier.", 'completion': 'IT KEEPS HAPENING'}
{'prompt': 'Ah, good. Looks like I can get a refund for earlier allocations.', 'completion': 'i told you rose. i TOLD you about stairs!'}
{'prompt': "Ok.. Consider me fully briefed on the matter of stairs.. Now if you don't mind, it's hard enough to concentrate on this without immersing ourselves in Strider's non sequitur.", 'completion': 'did you know he thinks puppets are cool?'}
{'prompt': 'Does he?', 'completion': "he's so dumb!!"}
{'prompt': "I made a shortcut upstairs. I thought it would be a good idea to get up there and try the cards as soon as possible.. Also, you weren't being terribly responsive.", 'completion': "you mean these stairs?. man, look at these shitty stairs.... they're so narrow! i'm supposed to climb those?"}
{'prompt': 'Have you ever been in there?', 'completion': 'no.'}
{'prompt': 'Exactly.', 'completion': 'huh?'}
{'prompt': "I'd rather not get sidetracked.. I'm more interested in further exploring the mechanics of the game than watching you discover what sort outlandish harlequin decor your father keeps in his room.", 'completion': "oh come on. what's the big deal, i'll just climb up and go right through!"}
{'prompt': 'Will you?', 'completion': 'yeah, why not?'}
{'prompt': "Are you saying you've never wondered what's in there? Or why it's been kept a secret from you?", 'completion': 'well, i mean yeah...'}
{'prompt': 'Then trust me. You won\'t be going "right on through."', 'completion': "wait, are you saying there's something, like.... troubling in there?"}
{'prompt': "I don't know.", 'completion': 'what do you mean? what do you see in there?'}
{'prompt': "I can't see in there.", 'completion': 'oh.'}
{'prompt': "But I don't have a very good feeling about it.", 'completion': 'pfff.... whatever!. i think i can handle a few more stupid clown paintings.'}
{'prompt': 'Wait, John, before you punch that.. Oh.. I was about to say.. If you first took note of the code, then removed the card from the card, you could have punched the blank one.. You would have only burned one card instead of two.', 'completion': "oh yeah, you're right.. dammit!"}
{'prompt': 'Yes.', 'completion': 'sweet, thanks!. what did you do with all the blue wobbly vase-looking things?'}
{'prompt': "I brought the totems out to the alchemiter to test them.. I'm taking some things into my own hands to save some time.", 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': 'What did you do?', 'completion': 'i combined the cards in the lathe thingy and made this!. it is so sweet, man look at me go.'}
{'prompt': 'I see.. That was a really good idea, John. Nice work.', 'completion': 'thanks!. i got the idea from harry anderson.'}
{'prompt': 'Who?', 'completion': 'uh, you know the show night court?'}
{'prompt': 'No.', 'completion': "oh.. well bottom line is.... he's awesome. that's really all there is to say on the matter!"}
{'prompt': 'Sweet catch?', 'completion': "... save.. oh, yeah.. that.. this is pretty comfy.. why don't you just like,. carry the bed around with me on it?. up to the gate up there!"}
{'prompt': "I can't interact with you directly, or anything that you are touching, if it will result in moving you.. See?", 'completion': 'oh.. lame!'}
{'prompt': 'The game probably regards that as a kind of cheating.. In a way, thieving you of your free will as an adventurer, and the need to advance by your own skill and ingenuity.. The server player is just a facilitator.', 'completion': "well, ok.. all that scurrying around kind of wore me out, i think i'm going to rest here for a bit.. rose, can you keep the imps at bay? like, drop some stuff on them if they sneak too close."}
{'prompt': 'No, you should pick up your hammer and defend yourself.', 'completion': 'what, come on!'}
{'prompt': "I have no idea what the hell Dave is up to, or if he's any closer to recovering the game.. There's some stuff I'd like to try, in case he doesn't come through.", 'completion': "oh alright.. i'm just gonna rest my eyes here a second though."}
{'prompt': 'hey!!!!', 'completion': 'whoa, there you are!'}
{'prompt': 'how is your adventure going john?', 'completion': "it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now."}
{'prompt': 'thats good!!', 'completion': "oh but, like.... i don't think i am actually saving the world here.. i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that."}
{'prompt': 'hmm well i think whatever it is it must be pretty important!. dont lose hope john i think it will all turn out for the best if you stay positive..... just keep listening to your grandmothers advice!!!', 'completion': "yeah, you're probably right.. but, um.... i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?"}
{'prompt': 'oh uhhh........ i dont know didnt you???', 'completion': 'hmm, i dunno, maybe you talked to rose or dave about it or something.'}
{'prompt': 'yeah maybe that was it!!', 'completion': "they're really weird when they talk to me about you, like they're always trying convince me you have some spooky powers, but i'm always like no she seems like a pretty regular girl to me!"}
{'prompt': 'heheheh', 'completion': 'but then when i think back maybe there are times when it seems like you know some things?. like maybe you know more about a thing than you are telling me? i dunno.'}
{'prompt': 'oh well john. i want to explain lots of things to you..... some things that i know. im just....... waiting!', 'completion': 'waiting for what!'}
{'prompt': 'oh! john!!!. i forgot i was messaging you about that meteor that fell near my house!', 'completion': 'oh yeah.. what ever happened with that?'}
{'prompt': 'oh boy.... well......... it turns out i was confused about it.... really confused! o_o;. see i guess i fell asleep for a while and...... lost track of time. that happens!!', 'completion': 'yeah i know, tell me about it!. maybe you should like, wear an alarm clock or something.. so what was the deal with the meteor?'}
{'prompt': 'well...... its hard to explain!!!. but.... i know what it is now!. and now i know everythings going to be ok!!!', 'completion': 'so what is it???. or is this just another thing you\'re "waiting" to tell me???'}
{'prompt': 'oh gosh john i really want to tell you all this stuff!!!. but i cant yet. i really think you need to wake up first!', 'completion': 'huh?'}
{'prompt': 'well ok not literally. well ok maybe KINDA literally!!', 'completion': 'AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!. stop being so confusing!!!!'}
{'prompt': 'Good work, John!', 'completion': "oh, hey!. you're back."}
{'prompt': "For now. I'll have to leave again shortly.. It looks like there's another large meteor headed for.... My present location.", 'completion': 'oh, so you mean dave connected with you?'}
{'prompt': "Not yet.. I'll explain later.. But I think I've determined that activating the timer in the game is not directly responsible for summoning a meteor to your location.. The countdown seems merely to exist as a kind of warning to the player.. As well as a strange coincidence.", 'completion': "um, ok.. i don't really think i get it.. is this relevant?"}
{'prompt': 'Probably not at the moment. And certainly not to you.. I have to go.', 'completion': 'ok, later!'}
{'prompt': "That's quite a totem collection.. What are you planning?", 'completion': "oh whoa hi!. oh.... gonna make some stuff.. are you ok? hasn't your house been on fire for like.... five hours now?"}
{'prompt': 'No, that was the nearby forest, which up until quite recently would have been best described as "on fire".. But you may be excited to learn that just as recently, my house finally notched that achievement.', 'completion': 'wow, congrats i guess?'}
{'prompt': 'Thank you. Have you seen Dave?', 'completion': "nah.. his bro is probably busy kicking his ass.. that's probably all there is to say on the matter."}
{'prompt': "Ok.. I'm going to start putting this grist to use too.. Let's be sparing with the frivolous knickknack breeding and focus on getting you up to the gate, ok?", 'completion': "yeah, ok i hear you, but.... i think we'll have plenty. i've been killing imps all over the house and now its lousy with gushers."}
{'prompt': 'Gushers?', 'completion': 'i mean grist.. serves them right for ruining my posters. the bastards.'}
{'prompt': 'Which posters?', 'completion': "don't you see? my sweet movie posters. look at them, they're fucking ruined."}
{'prompt': 'John.', 'completion': '??????'}
{'prompt': 'Are you suggesting that imps are responsible for defacing your movie posters?', 'completion': 'uh, YEAH?'}
{'prompt': "Your posters have looked like that ever since I first saw your room.. The moment we started playing this game.. I thought you had defaced them ironically to mock your father's interests.. John?. ...?", 'completion': 'VERY FUNNY ROSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'}
{'prompt': 'This is good.. Laughter is probably the best way to avoid being especially melodramatic about the revelation.', 'completion': "yes. YES. LET'S KEEP THIS JOKE GOING. BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A GOOD ONE. HA HA HA HA. OH MY. HA HA HA HA HA HA. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"}
{'prompt': 'I keep telling you the posters were always like that.', 'completion': 'AND I KEEP TELLING YOU HA HA VERY FUNNY'}
{'prompt': 'Here, look.. http. http', 'completion': "yeah, i saw those, but.... they didn't look like that before. you must have changed them."}
{'prompt': "Even if I had the motive for such a bizarre and pointless deception, where would I find the time?. I don't even have Photoshop.", 'completion': "then why didn't you TELL me they were there???"}
{'prompt': 'I had no reason to think you were not aware of them.. I thought they were strange, certainly, but was not struck by any particular impulse to discuss them.', 'completion': "ok, it still doesn't make sense though.. implying that i drew them a while ago and then forgot and couldn't see them and now suddenly see them.. that's stupid, what would that even mean."}
{'prompt': "It looks like you were in your father's room recently.", 'completion': 'yeah.'}
{'prompt': 'And how did it make you feel to discover what was in there?', 'completion': "oh no, i just realized!. you are going to psycho-therapify me.. well don't bother!"}
{'prompt': 'Maybe I am just being a friend?', 'completion': "maybe.... /EYES SUSPSICIOSLY. anyway i guess you saw what's in there, it's boring and there's not much to even see."}
{'prompt': "That doesn't matter.. What matters is how seeing it affected you.. I think it clearly has in some way.", 'completion': "well.... i don't know, at first i was nervous to go in and find more of his weird clowns, because of course they are stupid and i hate them a lot.. but then when i didn't see any, it was weird.. i felt weirdly, like... disappointed almost."}
{'prompt': 'Is it fair to say this changed your perception of your father?', 'completion': 'yeah, i guess.'}
{'prompt': 'Is it such a stretch to conclude it changed your perception of other things as well?', 'completion': "uh no, maybe not.. but what are you getting at?. it sounds like you're saying i'm crazy!"}
{'prompt': 'I don\'t like to use the word "crazy".', 'completion': 'oh god.. see?? this is therapy bullshit!'}
{'prompt': 'That was a joke.. But anyway, whether it means you are crazy or not, consider this theory. Your presumably longstanding tendency for scrawling this imagery is really your subconsious trying to express something disturbing within you.. Possibly something from your past, which you have blocked out.. And since you have supressed it, your conscious self cannot acknowledge the drawings, therefore they have been invisible until now.', 'completion': 'why now?'}
{'prompt': 'Perhaps because you have seen evidence that conflicts with the worldview your subconscious has constructed to obfuscate the truth.. That your dad is not necessarily the clown-loving maniac you thought he was.. All along, this negative attribute buried in your psyche may have been projected on to him, and subsequently reviled, as a sort of defense mechanism.', 'completion': "but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.. he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE."}
{'prompt': "Is it unthinkable that over the years it was he who believed you were the one with a passion for clowns? Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?. A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.. Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.. Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.", 'completion': 'i dunno.. not sure about all this.. but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.'}
{'prompt': "It's awesome.", 'completion': 'yeah.'}
{'prompt': "I'm trying to spread the upward construction around so there is a more substantial foundation for later on.. But I'm starting to wonder if it will be strong enough.. It's kind of starting to wobble a little.. I don't think brick chimneys were meant to serve this architectural purpose.", 'completion': 'yeah no shit!'}
{'prompt': 'I might have to adopt a different building strategy.. Stick to more load-bearing walls, and blockier shapes, especially since grist has been easier to come by lately.', 'completion': 'ok, but you really must be running low on time by now, right?'}
{'prompt': 'Right.', 'completion': 'STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!'}
{'prompt': 'john did you get my package??', 'completion': 'oh hey!. no, not yet.'}
{'prompt': 'darn! are you sure? it was in a green box.....', 'completion': "oh!. yes, but it is in my dad's car and he is still out at the store.. he should be back soon."}
{'prompt': 'great!!! so what are you up to today?', 'completion': 'i am up to my neck in this sburb stuff.. TT is making a royal mess of my house.'}
{'prompt': 'lol!. whats sburb??', 'completion': "oh, it is this game.. it's ok i guess. i'm still figuring it out."}
{'prompt': 'whoa what was that?????', 'completion': 'what was what?'}
{'prompt': 'there was a loud noise outside my house!!. it sounded like an explosion!!!!', 'completion': 'wow, really?'}
{'prompt': 'i will go outside and look....', 'completion': 'oh man, alright but be careful, ok?'}
{'prompt': 'i will!. im back!', 'completion': 'oh hi!'}
{'prompt': 'i went to investigate the explosion i heard', 'completion': 'was it by any chance a meteor?'}
{'prompt': 'yes!!!!!. how did you know??', 'completion': "oh man, it's kind of a long story!. anyway, are you ok? did it blow up your yard or start a fire or anything?"}
{'prompt': 'no i am fine!. it landed a pretty good ways from my house and i went to look at it. and its pretty big!. but bec doesnt want me to go near it. so i came home. he seems to think its dangerous!', 'completion': "well gosh, he's probably right!"}
{'prompt': 'anyway what have you been up to john?. oh!!!! did you get my package yet?', 'completion': 'er.... yeah, i was trying to get it, but rose dropped my car into a weird spooky bottomless pit and the package was in the car and im really sorry about that.'}
{'prompt': 'oh no!', 'completion': 'wow, ok, i guess i should start at the beginning.. see, a meteor blew up my neighborhood.'}
{'prompt': 'thats terrible john! im so sorry!', 'completion': "but i'm ok! and my house is too, sort of.. that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose, sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.. but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the world from the apocalypse!!!"}
{'prompt': 'O_O. well...... it sounds really crazy and kind of scary but...... it also sounds kind of exciting!. i dont know john maybe this is your destiny. if anyone can save the world i think it is probably you!', 'completion': 'wow, you think so?'}
{'prompt': 'yes!', 'completion': "well ok, BUT.. it's not even that simple!. i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from meteors and fire and stuff.. but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!. so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!. but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff."}
{'prompt': 'hahaha. he is so silly!', 'completion': 'yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.'}
{'prompt': 'hey!!!!', 'completion': 'whoa, there you are!'}
{'prompt': 'how is your adventure going john?', 'completion': "it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now."}
{'prompt': 'thats good!!', 'completion': "oh but, like.... i don't think i am actually saving the world here.. i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that."}
{'prompt': 'hmm well i think whatever it is it must be pretty important!. dont lose hope john i think it will all turn out for the best if you stay positive..... just keep listening to your grandmothers advice!!!', 'completion': "yeah, you're probably right.. but, um.... i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?"}

{'prompt': 'oh! john!!!. i forgot i was messaging you about that meteor that fell near my house!', 'completion': 'oh yeah.. what ever happened with that?'}

{'prompt': 'are you on the ground below the clouds yet?', 'completion': "yeah!. wait how did you know that's where the gate goes.... did you talk to rose? can she still see me while im down here?. she won't answer."}
{'prompt': 'no i havent talked to her yet but id like to soon. ive got a lot of catching up to do with all of you!. sorry ive been so scarce ive just been so busy running around like crazy and looking after my dog and stuff all day!!!!. i think he just locked me in my room actually', 'completion': 'oh man.. he sounds like such a handful.'}
{'prompt': 'yeah', 'completion': "but it's ok, i think he is mostly just looking after you.. like a guardian angel or something.. if i were you i would take him out behind the woodshed and give him a big hug."}
{'prompt': '. hey john can you hold on i have to talk to dave and start playing this game with him', 'completion': 'oh? what game?'}
{'prompt': 'sburb!!!! duh what else!', 'completion': "what, i thought you didn't even know what sburb was!"}
{'prompt': 'oh jeez i was asleep when i said that silly!. of course i know what it is', 'completion': 'oh ok.. where did you even get it?'}
{'prompt': 'from the ruins. its daves copy', 'completion': "wow.. the thing you just said doesn't even make the slightest bit of sense."}
{'prompt': 'i know right! hehehe. oh!!!!. that reminds me since im setting the game up with dave to be his server you are going to need to do the same thing for me', 'completion': 'oh really?. this is news to me.'}
{'prompt': 'can you see from where youre standing the place your dads car would have fallen?', 'completion': "oh yeah, i think so. it'll be kind of a long walk though, this place is huge."}
{'prompt': 'you should go there and get your copy of the server and set up with me...... oh and also get your package!!!!!!', 'completion': "okay.. wait, how did you know my dad's car fell down here?"}
{'prompt': 'johhhhn will you stop trying to trap me!!!. you TOLD me the car fell remember?. jeeeez', 'completion': 'jeeeeeeeeeeez!'}
{'prompt': 'JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!!!!!', 'completion': 'ok fine well color me suspicious anyway.. miss knowitall mcpsychicpants.'}
{'prompt': 'john im not any more psychic than you though', 'completion': 'ok sure i am convinced.. you have convinced me.. (PSYCHIC PSYCHIC PSYCHIC). also i told you the package was in the car but i never mentioned that the game was there too.. so kind of totally busted i guess.. GIVE ME A P. GIVE ME AN S'}
{'prompt': 'hahahaha oops ok!. i mean i know lots of things but im really serious its no more information than what you have access to. but you dont know it yet. anyway we can talk more about it soon...... i wont have to be so coy with you anymore because im pretty sure most of the stuff that was supposed to happen has already happened. i couldnt tell you about it because it would have messed it up!', 'completion': 'ok, that is fair.'}
{'prompt': 'FIND YOU?. WHAT DO YOU MEAN.', 'completion': 'i changed my chum handle to ditch you guys.. how did you find me?'}
{'prompt': 'OH.. HA HA!. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!. THIS IS THE LITTLE WORD HUMANS SAY REPEATEDLY WHEN SOMETHING TICKLES THEIR ABSURDITY PALATE, RIGHT?', 'completion': 'uh.... lame.'}

{'prompt': "OK, OUR BAD ON THAT.. JUST TELL HER WE'RE SORRY.. AND TO GET HER GROSS AND TOTALLY UNATTRACTIVE HUMAN BUTT OFF HER UGLY HUMAN HIGH HORSE AND ANSWER MY MESSAGES.", 'completion': "maybe.. we'll see.. i'm still not really sold on this friendship thing yet.. but i've got to go now and get on with my petty little quests.. so talk to you in the future i guess.. jerkface."}

I thought it was odd timing.', 'completion': "yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but like not the same session as ours or something.. oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but whatever."}
{'prompt': 'Color my curiosity piqued, I guess.', 'completion': "yeah, i guess answer him if you want. or not.. but anyway, it's great you made it here alive and stuff!. so dave came through?"}
{'prompt': "Eventually.. Pardon the envy I'm about to vent in your direction.", 'completion': 'for what?'}
{'prompt': 'For finding yourself at the mercy of a rational orchestrator.', 'completion': "oh, haha.. yeah, i'd feel kinda weird if dave was watching me too."}

{'prompt': 'what were you expecting. this is how it works. the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing. cycling through each planet. gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses. then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on her planet. you look for gate 4 somewhere there. which leads to gate 4 above my house. and so on', 'completion': 'wow, ok.'}
{'prompt': 'ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1. but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously. and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was built up. so you wouldnt fall to your death. but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine. see we all got to coordinate on this thing', 'completion': 'ok.... how do you know all this?'}
{'prompt': 'fuck. come on dude', 'completion': "oh yeah.... you're the orange dave.. hey no offense, but do you think i could talk to the real dave for a second?"}
{'prompt': 'god dammit. i am the real dave. you know the one who saved your life. im more real actually cause ive been through some heavy shit already hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year. and grinding shit out for your ungrateful ass. here look check out this code from the future not that you deserve it WIin189Q. youre fucking welcome', 'completion': "wow, calm down!. i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant.... i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is.... the dave from my time is also my friend, and i guess he's in the same boat i'm in, not knowing stuff and all.. and i'd feel bad keeping him out of the loop!"}
{'prompt': 'yo', 'completion': 'oh, hey.. i think i pissed off your future self.'}
{'prompt': 'what did you do', 'completion': "i said he wasn't the real dave."}
{'prompt': 'ahahahahaha', 'completion': 'i think i might have really hurt his feelings though!'}
{'prompt': 'pff. dont worry about it', 'completion': 'why not?'}
{'prompt': 'cause i wouldnt give a shit. and hes me', 'completion': "ok.. i'm in rose's room by the way."}
{'prompt': 'what. really', 'completion': "yeah, but she's asleep!"}
{'prompt': 'ok. dont go anywhere. im coming down to the computer', 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': 'dave is here he wants to use the computer. probably to help you scope out roses room and snoop and stuff. i mean thats what i would have done. if you were alive. so im gonna go. use these flappy ghost wings and tear shit up in space or something', 'completion': 'sure!. hey dave...'}
{'prompt': 'what', 'completion': 'in case i forgot to say so before.... thanks for saving my life!'}
{'prompt': 'dude no come on. shes out like a light anyway. it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep', 'completion': 'a future thing?'}
{'prompt': 'yeah. shit doesnt get more clear than that', 'completion': "well, yeah, she won't wake up.. so i guess so.. but i'm not snooping!!!"}
{'prompt': 'fine dont. but here just do this one thing. see those two notebooks on the floor behind you', 'completion': "yeah.. they look sorta like journals.. i don't think i should read those!"}
{'prompt': 'you dont have to read them im not telling you to. what kind of prying tool do you take me for. just pick them up. you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now', 'completion': 'uh, ok.'}
{'prompt': 'so you can see the code', 'completion': "wait a minute!. i see what you're trying to do.. i won't tell you the code for rose's books!"}
{'prompt': 'dude you dont have to tell me the code. just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all', 'completion': "ok.... i guess.. yeah there's a code."}
{'prompt': 'alright cool. you can ditch the books now if you want. maybe put them back on the floor. so rose doesnt think you were snooping. seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there. what is even with you', 'completion': 'HAHA DAVE,. I THINK ALL THIS LAUGHING MADE ME POOP IN MY PANTS TOO HARD.'}
{'prompt': 'isnt that your birthday package there', 'completion': 'oh, yeah, i think it might be.'}
{'prompt': 'maybe you should look at it. i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours', 'completion': 'yeah, maybe.. i wonder if she finished.... she was so tight lipped about the damn thing! i am really curious.'}
{'prompt': 'really powerful hammer', 'completion': "how do you know?. i thought you couldn't use hammers."}
{'prompt': 'i cant. better be though. got it from hephaestus', 'completion': "who's that?"}
{'prompt': 'really tough to kill dude', 'completion': 'you killed him for it?'}
{'prompt': 'nope', 'completion': "how'd you get it then?"}
{'prompt': 'shenanigans', 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': "THE POINT I WAS JUST MAKING.. ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.. YOU BLITHERING FECULENT SHITHOLE.. OK THAT'S YOUR CUE TO LAUGH AT ME SOME MORE I GUESS.. BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO REALLY GET OFF WHENEVER I FLAME YOU.. HUMANS ARE DERANGED.", 'completion': "oh man, i must be getting closer to the conversations where you're trolling me harder!. this is pretty exciting, i can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve."}
{'prompt': 'YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN??? FUCK YOU ABOUT THAT.', 'completion': "anyway, you weren't making a point about the ultimate riddle, dude."}
{'prompt': "YES I WAS, AND NOW I'M LOSING MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT DIPSHIT.", 'completion': 'nope, we never talked about it.. yet...'}
{'prompt': "OH HELL, THAT'S RIGHT.. DAMMIT, I GUESS THIS IS GOING TO BE CONFUSING.", 'completion': "oh, you're just starting to figure that out now?"}
{'prompt': "SEE I KIND OF PAINTED MYSELF INTO A CORNER.. I STARTED TROLLING YOU AT THE END, JUST BEFORE THE RIFT.. AND THEN JUMPED BACK A LITTLE.. AND NOW I GUESS I'VE BECOME RAILROADED INTO WORKING BACKWARDS HERE.. UNLESS I WANT TO DO THE SORT OF DUMB SCHIZOPHRENIC HOPPING AROUND LIKE THE OTHERS.", 'completion': "oh my god, i know, you've already told me like a million times!!!"}
{'prompt': "I HAVE?. WOW I CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL THESE AMAZING CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.. IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THAT HUMAN VACATION WITH THE GIANT RED CHIMNEY ASSHOLE UP IN HERE.. YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE A BUNCH OF MOANY NOOKSUCKERS SING AT A LITTLE PINE TREE I THINK.", 'completion': 'man, i\'ve got to say i\'m a little disappointed by this "masterful trolling" you were bragging about.'}
{'prompt': 'I WAS BRAGGING?. WHY WOULD I BOTHER WITH THAT SORT OF PEDANTIC HUMAN HORSESHIT.. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT I WAS BRAGGING TO GET YOUR HOPES UP IN THE FUTURE.. ONLY TO LET YOU DOWN.. AND THUS TROLL YOU MASTERFULLY IN THAT RESPECT.', 'completion': 'maybe, but that would be pretty weak too!!!'}
{'prompt': "YOUR BRITTLE HUMAN CALCIUM BASED SKULL IS WHAT IS WEAK, AND IF YOU AND I WERE IN THE PROXIMITY OF A BLUNT INSTRUMENT I WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE PROVING IT.", 'completion': 'w/e.. so what was the "case in point" you were making, anyway?'}
{'prompt': 'I WAS SCROLLING BACK AND NOTICED YOU WERE IN THE VEIL.', 'completion': 'whoa, i am?'}
{'prompt': "YEAH DUMBDUMB, YOU'RE TUMBLING AROUND ON A BIG GODDAMN METEOR.. AND YOU JUST CREATED YOUNGER VERSIONS OF YOURSELVES AND YOUR GUARDIANS.. PROBABLY BY MUCKING AROUND WITH THAT THING LIKE A DOOFUS.", 'completion': 'wait.... these are baby versions of us?'}
{'prompt': 'HAHAHAHAHAHA, SO CLUELESS.. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING THERE ANYWAY.', 'completion': "well.... i saw footage of my nanna, and some other people who i am pretty sure were like jade's grandpa and rose's mom and stuff from a long time ago.. and then.... there were all these little guys scurrying around.. so they are like cloned copies of us?"}
{'prompt': 'NO.. THEY ARE LITERALLY YOU AND YOUR GUARDIANS.. PARADOX CLONES.', 'completion': 'huh?. what do you mean they are literally us?. do they go back in time?'}
{'prompt': "YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. GREAT GUESS BRAIN HERO.. BUT TECHNICALLY THEY AREN'T EVEN SENT BACK IN TIME BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM YOUR UNIVERSE'S TIMELINE IS MEANINGLESS.. SERIOUSLY WHY WOULD IT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT EARTH'S PAST OR FUTURE OR WHATEVER, FROM IT'S PERSPECTIVE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF POINTS TO CHOOSE FROM.. JUST LIKE YOUR CHRONOLOGY IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.. BUT I GUESS THAT'S A BUNCH OF SEMANTICS. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL CHRONOLOGY YEAH THEY GO BACK IN TIME.. A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED.. IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE STABLE LOOP CONTINUUM.. I DON'T SEE ANY TENTACLES OR EXTRA EYEBALLS OR WARPED BONE BULGES, SO THOSE GROSS LITTLE THINGS THERE ARE ALL YOU GUYS, WAITING TO GO TO EARTH AND GROW UP AND BECOME THE INSIPID BUNCH OF GRUBFISTED DOUCHEBAGS YOU ALL ARE NOW.. AND THIS WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.", 'completion': 'what is the riddle anyway?. maybe i can guess, i am good at riddles!'}
{'prompt': "HAHAHA, THINK AGAIN IGNORAMUS.. IT'S NOT EVEN THAT GREAT.. OR EVEN MUCH OF A RIDDLE AT ALL.. IN THE COURSE OF YOUR ADVENTURE YOU WOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED ALL THESE FRAGMENTS OF LIKE WEIRD POEMS AND SHIT.. YOU FIND THEM ALONG YOUR QUESTS, WITH CLUES AND STUFF BURIED IN THEM TO HELP YOU SOLVE PUZZLES AND MOVE HUGE STONE COLUMNS AND MAKE STAIRCASES APPEAR AND LOTS OF NONSENSE LIKE THAT.. AND IT'S ALL MASKED IN THIS FLOWERY SORT OF FROTHY POETIC JACKASSERY THAT NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT.. AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT FOR YOU.. BUT WHAT ALL THESE LOFTY SYMBOLIC ALLUSIONS BOIL DOWN TO IS SOME GRANDER STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING HERE.. THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS THE KEY TO SEEDING YOUR OWN EXISTENCE THROUGH THIS GAME.. AND ANY HOPE THAT IT COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY OR THAT YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS WHOLE MESS WAS ALWAYS JUST A RUSE.", 'completion': 'a distaction, perhaps?'}
{'prompt': 'WHAT?', 'completion': 'nevermind.'}
{'prompt': "BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS WAY THEN HOW WERE YOU EVEN BORN, GET IT.. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PATHETIC SINCE PARADOX SPACE APPARENTLY WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE TO MAKE YOU JUST TO HAVE YOU FAIL AND DIE.. REALLY THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THESE NULL SESSIONS FULL OF KIDS ENTERING THE GAME AND FULFILLING SOME COSMIC DESTINY SHIT JUST TO GET WIPED OUT AND LEAVE BEHIND AN EMPTY POINTLESS INCIPISPHERE FOR ALL ETERNITY.. ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF HILARIOUS.. OR IT WOULD BE IF IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.. BUT ANYWAY, THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE RIDDLE THAN JUST THAT, LIKE WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME WE TALKED.. BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE GIST OF THE THEMES IT DEALS WITH.", 'completion': 'ok.. well, if i run into some salamanders who tell me all about this riddle and get really excited about it, i will try to act surprised.. so this is the same kind of thing you went through?. with, like, being your own paradox clones and creating your own parents and stuff?'}
{'prompt': 'YEAH.', 'completion': 'how did that even work, with 12 of you?'}
{'prompt': "IT WAS REALLY FUCKING COMPLICATED AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT.. OUR FAMILY STRUCTURES ARE ALREADY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOURS WITHOUT EVEN GETTING SPOOKY TIME SLIME INVOLVED.. BASICALLY WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHATSOEVER.. EXCEPT MAYBE THIS.... I WAS THE GUY IN YOUR POSITION, TO MAKE ALL THESE CLONES, AND FRANKLY IT ALL KIND OF FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT.", 'completion': 'huh.... yeah, i guess now that you mention it, i am finding it all a little strange...'}
{'prompt': 'OH, ONLY JUST NOW???. FUCK YOU ARE FAST, I HOPE YOU GOT THE MAD BOONBUCKS TO PAY OFF THOSE SPEEDING TICKETS.', 'completion': "no, no, i mean the ghost stuff and paradoxes are one thing of course.... it's something else.. it's just.... this is really weird..."}
{'prompt': "WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.", 'completion': 'well, normally humans hatch.... from like these slimy pods.. then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.'}
{'prompt': 'OH REALLY.. HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.', 'completion': '(hehehehehehehe)'}
{'prompt': "MAYBE THOSE REALLY ARE MUTANT CLONES AND THEY AREN'T GOING BACK TO SEED YOUR PLANET???", 'completion': 'um.... sure...?'}
{'prompt': "HELL, I'M CONFUSED NOW.. NOT THAT I GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR POINTLESS AWFUL LIVES.", 'completion': "hey, i have an idea.. why don't you get back to me in a few minutes?. i mean like a few minutes of my time, not yours.. all of these little pink monkeys are getting way out of line and i have to tend to them.. if you message me in a couple minutes, we can continue conversing in a sane, linear fashion for a change!"}
{'prompt': 'UM, OK?', 'completion': 'and then after that you can keep going backwards and then make fun of me riding my little red rocket.. you can tell me i look like a silly little paradox clone fresh out of my slime tube and this is just all a big nurseytime recess jamboree.. that would burn me good!'}
{'prompt': "OK THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.. BUT I CAN'T USE IT, BECAUSE YOU SAID IT, AND THEN LATER, I.E. RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD GET THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU WERE THE ONE TO COME UP WITH THAT BURN.. SEE, YOU ARE DEALING WITH A PRO, YOU CAN'T OUT TROLL ME SO JUST FORGET ABOUT IT AND STOP TRYING.", 'completion': '(hehehehehehehehehehehe)'}
{'prompt': 'OK AWESOME, NOW FUCK YOU AND GOODBYE.', 'completion': 'wait!'}
{'prompt': 'WHAT.', 'completion': 'i was just looking at all these rascals, and i was wondering.... how they go back in time and become us and stuff.. does it have something to do with the reckoning?'}
{'prompt': 'HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.', 'completion': 'you told me.. we had this great dare going.. to see who could be the least helpful and informative.. and you totally lost, dude!. you were hella helpful.'}
{'prompt': 'I WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST SPITING YOUR STUPID POINTLESS HUMAN DARE.. WHAT IS A DARE ANYWAY, IT\'S NOTHING.. SOMEONE SAYS DO SOMETHING AND THEN, OH LAUGH LAUGH, YOU LOSE IF YOU DON\'T DO IT.. THAT ISN\'T ANYTHING THAT DESERVES A WORD.. WE DON\'T EVEN HAVE A WORD FOR DARE IN OUR LANGUAGE.. THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION WOULD BE "WORTHLESS FUCKING BULLSHIT WASTE OF TIME FOR SILLY LITTLE CHILDREN"', 'completion': 'oh, wow.. is that the title of a movie too?'}
{'prompt': "YES, IT'S THE TITLE OF EVERY DUMB MOVIE YOU EVER LIKED.", 'completion': "ha ha, that isn't even true and doesn't make sense!"}
{'prompt': "ANYWAY, HOW COULD WE HAVE MADE A DARE IF I'M MOVING BACKWARDS ON YOUR TIMELINE.. YOU WOULD DARE ME TO DO SOMETHING, THEN I WOULD DO IT NEXT TIME, BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE DARE.. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE IT YET.. THAT'S WHAT ISN'T TRUE AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU DAMP BAG OF PUKE.", 'completion': 'well yeah, the dare never happened, i was joking around and made that up to give you hard time.'}
{'prompt': 'YOU HAVE SOUNDING STUPID DOWN TO SUCH A SCIENCE.. WHERE IS YOUR LAB COAT AND TEST TUBES DOCTOR BRAIN PROFESSOR?', 'completion': 'i am wearing a lab coat!. sort of...'}
{'prompt': 'YOU LOOK LIKE AN ELF.', 'completion': "that's bullshit!"}
{'prompt': 'YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE BLOWING INTO A FUNNY LITTLE SHELL, AND LIMBERING UP FOR A SILLY COOKIE DANCE.', 'completion': 'do you even have elves?'}
{'prompt': "YES, LET'S COMPARE WHICH FANTASY CREATURES THAT DON'T EXIST WE BOTH DO OR DON'T NOT HAVE.. WHAT A GREAT FUCKING IDEA, JOHN!", 'completion': 'uh, what?'}
{'prompt': "YOU ASKED ABOUT THE RECKONING, SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF ALL THESE PRETTY MUCH TERRIBLE THINGS.", 'completion': 'ok.'}
{'prompt': 'YEAH, SO WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS HAPPENING, ALL THESE PARADOX CLONES GET SHIPPED OFF TO METEORS, FLUNG THROUGH SKAIAN DEFENSE PORTALS, AND SENT BACK TO EARTH.. END OF STORY I GUESS.. BYE.', 'completion': 'wait!!!. so that means.... we are all sort of like superman?'}
{'prompt': 'UH YEAH, I GUESS.', 'completion': 'cool!'}
{'prompt': "YOU ALL TRACE THE MYTHOLOGICAL FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR BELOVED HUMAN SUPERMAN WHO'S REALLY JUST A MUSCULAR CAUCASIAN ALIEN.. IT'S HILARIOUS HOW HUMANS WORSHIP HIM AS A PINNACLE OF HUMAN HEROISM AND VIRTUE BUT HE ISN'T EVEN HUMAN.. ACTUALLY IT'S INCREDIBLY PATHETIC.. BUT ALSO IN A WAY KIND OF ADMIRABLE.. BECAUSE IT MEANS DEEP DOWN YOU ALL MUST REALIZE WHO YOUR DADDY IS.. WE ARE, BITCHES.", 'completion': 'yeah, superman is pretty cool, i guess.. did you know nicolas cage was almost going to play superman one time?'}
{'prompt': 'OH MY THROBBING PHLEGM LOBE, WHO GIVES A BARFING FUCK ABOUT THAT.. JOHN EGBERT, YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED MY PATIENCE.. ADIOS LOSER.', 'completion': 'wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. get back to me in a couple minutes, ok?'}
{'prompt': "YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.. BUT YOU ARE ABOUT TO START PASSING OUT BUNNIES LIKE THEY'RE CHEAP CIGARS.. IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMBARRASSING DISPLAY.", 'completion': 'what are you talking about?'}
{'prompt': "YEAH, EXACTLY, NUMSKULL.. LET'S JUST HAVE OUR CHAT, THEN IT CAN NATURALLY OCCUR TO YOU TO BE AN IDIOT IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME.", 'completion': 'ok.... i was sort of mulling it over while looking at all these babies with guns and sitting on ponies and things.... and how the reckoning takes them back.. and how you said our reckoning starts sooner.'}
{'prompt': 'YEAH.', 'completion': "are you sure it has to start so soon? can't we delay it?"}
{'prompt': "HAHAHAHA.. IT STARTS IN A FEW MINUTES STUPID.. SEE THAT COUNTDOWN CLOCK OVER THERE?. YOU AREN'T DELAYING ANYTHING.", 'completion': 'oh... dang!. i guess i better get off this meteor then!'}
{'prompt': "WELL I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE.. FIRST SOME SMALLER METEORS GO.. THEN BIGGER ONES.. SPREAD OUT OVER LIKE 24 HOURS OR SO.. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE.... GO TIME.. WHEN IT STARTS.. LIKE IT'S TIME TO HURRY UP AND STOP FUCKING AROUND AND KILL THE BOSS, GET IT?. THE ROCK YOU'RE ON DOESN'T BLAST OFF RIGHT AWAY.. TOO BAD, BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE SPARED YOU FROM MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF IN A COUPLE MINUTES, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, SPARED ME FROM HAVING TO WATCH.", 'completion': "ok, well you keep saying how doomed we are and how all this bad stuff happens sooner, but you never say why!. what happens in our game that's different from yours that makes things go so badly?"}
{'prompt': "AN AGENT OF DERSE.. WHO FLIPPED OUT AND ROSE TO POWER.. HE KILLED YOUR BLACK QUEEN AND KING AND NOW HE'S IN CHARGE.", 'completion': "so you didn't have him in your game?"}
{'prompt': "NO, WE DID.. BUT HE WAS HARMLESS.. ACTUALLY, HE WAS AN ALLY, SORT OF.. HE SETTLED A GRUDGE AGAINST THE QUEEN BY HELPING US DETHRONE AND EXILE HER.. AND THEN HE WOUND UP EXILED HIMSELF, AND SORT OF KEPT HELPING US THROUGH A COMMAND TERMINAL ON OUR OLD PLANET.. HE'S KIND OF A HUGE ASSHOLE THOUGH.. BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK THE QUEEN OUT OF THE PICTURE, WHEN WE GOT TO SKAIA WE ONLY HAD ONE MONARCH TO DEAL WITH INSTEAD OF TWO.. OF COURSE IT WAS A NASTY GIANT 12X PROTOTYPED BLACK KING THAT TOOK FOREVER TO KILL, JUST BARELY IN TIME BEFORE THE BIGGEST METEORS CAME, BUT STILL.", 'completion': 'i see.. so after he got exiled and all that, he came here into our game and caused all this trouble?'}
{'prompt': "NO, GOD.. EGBERT YOU ARE THICKER THAN THAT HIDEOUS JOKE BOOK YOU WADDLE AROUND WITH.. TRY TO THINK MORE ABSTRACTLY.. THINK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES.. WHAT'S AN EARTH GAME YOU LIKED TO PLAY?. NAME ONE.", 'completion': 'ummmm.... crash bandicoot?'}
{'prompt': "OK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S A REALLY LAME EXAMPLE, BUT THAT'S FINE, IT'S NOT THE POINT.. SO LET'S SAY YOU PLAY YOUR BANDICOOT AND I PLAY MY BANDICOOT.. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BANDICOOT, SAME APPEARANCE AND DESIGN AND BEHAVIORS.. BUT THEY ARE STILL COMPLETELY SEPARATE BANDICOOTS ON SEPARATE SCREENS.. SO WE BOTH HAVE OUR OWN ASS BANDICOOTS TO OURSELVES, THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT.. OUR JACKS ARE THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT TOO.. SAME GUY, DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND OUTCOMES.. OUR JACK TRUMPED THE QUEEN, BUT GOT NO FURTHER.. YOUR JACK GOT THE BEST OF BOTH OF THEM, AND IS NOW SOMETHING HIGHER THAN A QUEEN OR A KING...", 'completion': 'like an ace?'}
{'prompt': 'SURE OK.', 'completion': 'ok, i think i get it.. but how did he do that? what was different about what we did versus what you did?'}
{'prompt': "FRANKLY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ORIGINAL THING THAT TIPPED THE SCALE WAS.. IT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.. THE WORST IS YET TO COME.. FOR YOU.", 'completion': 'oh no!. what is the worst thing?'}
{'prompt': 'ALREADY TOLD YOU.', 'completion': 'dammit!. oh, hey.... sorry, hold on, this little lady is bugging me about something.'}
{'prompt': 'YEAH YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH AND GIVE HER THE LOUSY RABBIT ALREADY.', 'completion': 'oh!!!!!. oh man, i just had THE BEST idea, this is so perfect.. a blonde mother and daughter together, this is totally perfect.'}
{'prompt': 'PERFECT FOR WHAT, FLEXING YOUR FORMIDABLE MENTAL HANDICAP LIKE A FUCKING HEAVYWEIGHT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES?. OH WAIT, LET ME CHECK, THE ANSWER IS YES.', 'completion': 'it is like that scene in con air, i will give her the bunny like i am nick cage fresh out of the slammer.'}
{'prompt': 'FUCK.', 'completion': 'i wish i had a filthy wifebeater on, oh well.'}
