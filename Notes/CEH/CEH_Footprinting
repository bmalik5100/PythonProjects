Footprinting resources:
Google
Shodan
Censys Search

	Footprinting:
Learning any information about a victim AKA OSINT gathering
Two Types:
  Passive - no interaction with target, freely available public information
    Extremely difficult to detect
  Active - Making direct contact with target, e.g host discovery, port scans, etc
    More possible to detect
Information to Gather:
  System information - OS, services like AD or LDAP, DNS
  Network informtation - firewall rules, domains/subdomains, hosts
  Organizational information - Org charts, employee information
Information to be used for vulnerability assessment

	Google Dorks:
Definition - Using advanced search features of google to do footprinting
Examples:
  inurl:
  intitle:
  related:
  link:
  site:
Pair many together to get a more and more specific google entry for recon.

	Shodan and Censys:
Search engines that find more hosts than just web servers, e.g. firewalls, IoT, etc
Shodan - Search engine for Internet-Connected devices:
  Free version, and teired access
  shows ports, IPs, vulnerabilities, country/region of origin, etc.
  Filters available
Censys - Discover, monitor, analyze devices publicly accessible to internet (same as Shodan):
  Raw headers, host information, ssh banners, etc

	Sub-domain Enumeration:
Subdomain - subdomain.domain.com, organization of domains to connect different parts of organization to same top domain. below GTLD
Purpose - Discover more (possibly vulnerable) areas as part of victims attack surface
Methods:
  Google dorking - $ site:example.com
  View Source - ctrl + f and looking at source html pages for subdomains
  Netcraft Search DNS - online tool to search DNS records by domain 
  sublister - in apt, cmdline tool (-d for domains, -t for threads), go slow so you don't get banned

	Social Networking Recon:
Basically Social Media Stalking
Company information - ID Badge information, 3rd party info
employee information - email, job titles, interests, technologies used, location information
Linkedin - very organizational
Automation:
  TheHarvester - not as good as it used to be, better for subdomains, ip addresses, etc
  sherlock - commandline username enumerator
  socialsearcher - online tool looking for hashtags
Client websites - look for email domains

	Job Board Recon:
Description - shows different technologies and organizational charts used in qualifications ex. looking for SQL dev uses SQL and reports to xyz.
Contact information - email addresses, locations
Look in both job boards and client site openings

	Deep/Dark web Recon:
Deep web - beyond surface web, unable to be searched/indexed, cannot reach without authorization
Dark Net - Anonymous/Hidden network by nature using encryption, such as Tor Network, safer to use VM
  E.g. Freenet - peer-to-peer platform used by journalists in hostile areas
       Retroshare - peer-to-peer chat/mail/filesharing
Dark web - Websites that exist on the dark net
Tor Browser - Access the dark web
  Hidden Wiki - Multiple links for various categories of sites

	Email Tracking:
Email Tracking - Getting information from emails, e.g. mouse movements, IP address, browser, etc
Email Tracking:
  Read receipts -  
  Tracking Pixels - Tiny embedded images built/coded to track user activity (often used by marketers)
  Tracking Links - Same as above, but triggered by telemetric data grabbed when visitng a link
Email Tracking Services:
  Github - Various open source projects 
  Linkly - Paid tracking link service
  Bitly  - Tracking Link service

	DNS and WHOIS Enumerations:
WHOIS - Registry of information:
  Thick Model: Admin info, Billin info, Domain information, Point of Contacts
  Thin Model: Just who is it registered with
  Example of site query: Search at https://who.is
DNS - Domain Name Service:
  Discern Domain names, IP addresses, mail server info
  Standard for Query is nslookup or dig -axfr @ (for zone transfer)
  CDN information

	Social Engineering Techniques:
Eavesdropping - Listening in on Phone, Email, Text/Audio/Videos
Shoulder Surfing - Looking over someone entering passwords, PINs, Account/CC numbers
Dumpster Diving - Looking in trash to find valuable information
Impersonation - Convincing a party that you are authorized to get information/data

	Other Footprinting Tools:
FOCA - Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives
  Mainly used to find metadata and hidden in formation in the documents it scans.
  Runs on windows
  Used commonly for OSINT and Pen Testing
  Analyzes Microsoft office, open office, etc.
OSINT Framework - Open Source Intelligence
  Runs in the browser
Metagoofil - Metadata
ExifTool - Metadata
ReconDog - Python Driven OSINT automation tool
  Github Repo - w/requirements.txt
  API driven
  Lots of lookups and scans
MALTEGO - Organize your thoughts
  Paid product with community version in apt
  Maps assets together
  Graphically-driven tool to create maps of data and footprint tracking
  Similar tool is Obsidian
Recon-ng - 
  Create workspaces
  Kind of like metasploit

	Footprinting & Recon Countermeasures:
This is hard to do.
Security Policies - Allows for universal security across an organization. Ensures good practice is enforced.
End-User education training - makes sure that even non-technical users are educated on 
Opting In to WHOIS security privacy information
ENCRYPTION ENCRYPTION ENCRYPTION - No good reason not to use encryption
Authentication Methods - Important for accessibility only for people who SHOULD access data
Be Safe on social media - Reasonable paranoia
Disabling Location Services
Sanitize job listings - be selective about data you share
