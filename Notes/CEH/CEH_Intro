	Basic Concepts:
CIA - Data Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
Red (Offensive Security) & Blue (Defensive Security) teams & Purple team
Types of Hackers - White Hat, Black Hat, Grey Hat, Suicide Hacker, Script Kiddies, Cyber Terrorist, State-Sponsored, Hacktivist

	Attack Classifications:
Passive (Packet Sniffing, NMAPing, etc) 
Active (DoS, Password Attack, SQLi, RCE, etc)
Close-In (Social Engineering, Dumpster Diving, Shoulder Surfing, etc)
Insider Threads
Distribution Attack - AKA Supply Chain

	Cyber Kill Chain:
Passive Recon - Harvesting emails, conference data, public info, etc
Weaponization - Coding exploit with backdoor into deliverable a deliverable payload  
Delivery - Delivering a weaponized bundle to victive via email, USB, etc
Exploitation - Exploit a vulnerability to execute code on victims system
Installation - Installing malware on asset
Command and Control (C2) - Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
Actions and Objectives

	Tactics, Techniques and Procedures - Attacker Behaviors
Used to determine and predict black hat behavior 
Tactics - Initial Objectives and Goals
Techniques - Methods to acheive goals and objectives
Procedures - Mechanisms or tools to perform those methods

	Common Adversarial Behaviors
Internal Recon - Passive reconissance/scanning/enumerating internal networks. Look for hosts, configs, services, users, etc (PS1, BASH)
Command Line / Terminal - Modify and Read data automatically
Web Shell - Browser based connection to shell (often using php, perl, etc) to execute commands remotely
Command and Control - BOLO C2 traffic to block
DNS Tunnelling - 
Data Staging - Collection of data that is ready to be extracted
What to do - Logging and monitoring

	Thread hunting Models:
Threat hunting can generate Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
IoC data:
  Atomic - Self-Contained data, such as IP or email address
  Computed - Derived data, such as hash values, regex
  Behavioral - Logically combining atomic and computed
IoC categories:
  Email Artifcats, such as sender email, subject line, attachments or links
  Network Artifacts, such as domain info or IP addresses
  Host-Bashed Artifacts, such as file names, registry entries, drivers, hash values
  Behavioral Artifacts, such as Macros, or service accounts
High or unusual login activity - /var/log/auth.log

	Risk And Risk Management:
Threat x Vulnerability x Impact = Risk
Threat x Vulnerability x Asset Value= Risk
Basically, probability a negative event will occur and outcome of negative event
Risk Leveles:
  Impact x Probability = Risk Level
  Low: Threat, but unlikely to occur and/or impact is negligible
  Medium: Threat is likely, but not imminent. Mitigate asap to reduce risk
RAG Chart, aka Risk matrix:
		High	3	4	5
Likelyhood	Medium	2	3	4	1 to 5, 5 being most risky
		Low	1	2	3
			Low	Medium	High
			      Impact
Stages:
  Identify Risks -> Assessment Likelyhood/Impact and Prioritization -> Treatment -> Track and Review

	Cyber Threat Intelligence:
Gathering of data and intelligence related to threats.
High-Level
  Strategic - Long term things
  Operational - Immediate things
Low-Level
  Technical - Specifics/details of tactical methods
  Tactical - Strategy of cyber threat

	Threat Modeling:
Steps:
  Identify security objectives - Compliance, Law, etc
  Application Overview - Identify Roles, (mis)usage scenarios, suite of technologies related to an application
  Decompose the Application - breakdown app into components (diagrams help)
  Identify Threats
  Identify Vulnerabilities
STRIDE Threat Model
PASTA Threat Model - Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
DREAD Threat model
	D amage
	R eproducibility
	E xploitability
	A ffected Users
	D iscoverability
Online resources available

	Incident Management Handling And Response:
Process by which we:
  Identify
  Analyze
  Prioritize
  Resolve
In order to restore normal operations asap
Steps:
  Preparation - Create Policy, training, procedure
  Incident Recording and Assignment - Address how to properly report and record incident
  Triage - Analyze, confirm, categorize, and prioritize Security Incident
  Notification - Inform stakeholders, management, clients, 3rd party vendors, etc
  Containment - Pull the plug
  Evidence Gathering and Forensic analysis
  Eradication - Remove root cause of the incident
  Recovery - Bring affected resources back online
  Post-Incident Activities - Final Review & Documentation

	Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:
AI - Human-like problem solving
ML - AI conditional learning taking in datasets to compute 
Learning Techniques (ML):
  Supervised Learning - labelled datasets training ML in order to CLASSIFY data and compute REGRESSION
    Classification - Classify/categorize data into defnied groups
    Regression - Discern the relationship between independent and dependent variables
  Unsupervised Learning - unlabelled datasets training ML to look for patterns in order to CLUSTER, ASSOCIATE, and REDUCE DIMENSIONALITY
    Cluster - Grouping unlabeled data based on similarities/differences
    Association - Discovery of relationships between variables in a given dataset
    Dimensionality Reduction - Reduces high number of data inputs to a manageable size
Usage in Sec: Endpoint Protection, Authentication, Network Security, Captcha, Behavioral Analysis, AI vs AI, Phishing, Threat Detection, Vulnerability Assessment and Management

	EC Council CEH Hacking Methodology:
Ethical Hacking Steps:
  1. Planning and Reconnaissance - (OSINT) Gathering public information
  2. Scanning - Active Host/Vulnerability/Port discovery
  3. Gaining Access / Priviledge escalation - Exploiting vulnerabilites, phishing
  4. Maintaining Access - backdoor Malware (C2 agent), phantom user account
  5. Analysis and WAF Configuration / Clearing Track - Exfiltration & Covering your tracks, Shredding

	MITRE ATT&CK Framework:
Emulation of threats by following framework using global knowledgebase
Enterprise Tactics Columns

	Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis:
Structure for analyzing attacks, threats, etc to guide decision making during intrusion
	      Adversary
	        /  \
Infrastructure <----> Capability
	        \  /
	       Victim
Victims:
  Who is being hacked
  Victim Persona (Who), Victim Asset (What - aka attack surface)
Adversary:
  Threat actor (Most likely to be unknown)
  Adversary Operator (Actual hacker), Adversary Customer (Who is gaining from hack)
Capability:
  TTP of hacker
  Caoacity (Ability), Arsenal (Resources)
Infrastructure
  Any physical or logical items that can be used to attack victim (person, email, phone)
  Fully owned/controlled by adversary, Owned by third party used to attack
  Service providers - cloud providers, DNS, ISPs, unwitting participants
Meta-Features:
  Timestamps - date and time events occur
  Phases - steps of hacking process (e.g. cyber kill chain)
MF - Results:
  What did adversary accomplish and how was victim affected.
  Think CIA model, what was affected
  Post-Conditions
MF - Directionality:
  Infrastructure to victim, adversary to capability, etc
MF - Methodology:
  Labelling as a class of activity, AKA M.O.
MF - Resources:
  Resources REQUIRED for event to occur
  Software, hardware, access, funds, etc.
