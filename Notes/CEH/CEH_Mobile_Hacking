	Mobile Security Basics:
Mobile Attack Surfaces, vulnerabilities, and threats:
  Mobile Device itself:
    Android and iOS release constant security updates/patches
  Malware:
    MalwareZoo has many public malware installed through browser, appstore, etc
  Bluetooth:
    Bluejacking - sending unsolicited messages over bluetooth
    Bluesnarfing - unauthorized access of a phone features, contacts, calendars, etc
    Bluebugging - Similar to bluesnarfing, accesses all phone features
    Blueborne - 
  Wifi
  Telco (Cellular service provider)
  SS7 (Common channel signaling system no 7)
    Outdated protocol providing interoperability between providers
    Need specialized hardware
    Services:
      SMS, Billing, Call waiting/forwarding
    Attacker can tap into network using laptop and SS7 SDK
    Attacker can then eavesdrop on conversations
App Stores:
  Malicious Apps in Official App stores
  Third-Party App stores
    F-Droid is a popular android app store
  Web browser (XSS, CSRF, etc)
  VPN - can be breached/compromised and can access everything if trusted
  Weak/No Encryption (Such as SMS)

OWASP TOP 10 for Mobile:
  M1: Improper Credential Usage
  M2: Inadequate Supply Chain Security
  M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization
  M4: Insufficient I/O Validation
  M5: Insecure Communication
  M6: Inadequate Privacy Controls
  M7: Insufficient Binary Protections
  M8: Security Misconfiguration
  M9: Insecure Data Storage
  M10: Insufficient Cryptography

Sandbox Bypass/Escape
SIM hijacking 
Moblie Spam
SMShing/Phishing
NSO Group (Pegasus/Darknet Diaries)
Theft of Device

	Android Security:
Operating System - 3 of 4 devices are android
Open source, linux based, developed by google
App development - free ADK
Rooting - Gaining full administrative "root" access to device
Pros to Rooting: Bypass device controls, tethering, delete bloatware
Cons to rooting: Security risks/malware infections more common with sideloaded apps, voided warranty, brick the device
Tools for rooting (After device is placed in USB Debugging mode):
  Kingoroot
  Towelroot
  Oneclickroot - Most Common
Tools for hacking using android phones:
  LOIC for android
  Drozer - vulnerability scanner
  zANTI - Professional paid Hacking toolkit
  Kali Linux Nethunter 
  Droid Sheep - MITM (Unprotected web HTTP over wifi) attacks and Vulnerabilty Attacks 
  adb (android debug bridge) - gives shell access to install and debug apps
  cSploit - Deprecated Mobile version of metasploit

Security Defenses:
  Don't Root your device
  Use screen lock with decent password
  Avoid sideloading & third party app stores without thorough due diligence
  Install antimalware/antivirus
  Keep phone updated and patched
  Don't open links with attachments from emails or texts
  Use vpns for sensitive data
  Use where's my droid/Find my phone
  

	iOS Security:
Basics:
  Developed by Apple
  All apps come from single official apple app store 
  Security Measures:
    Secureboot built in, faceID, passcodes, touchID, code-signing for third party apps, app sandboxing
    All third-party apps are verified by Apple
Jailbreaking - Bypassing security controls and gaining full access of device
Pros: Removes sandbox restrictions, allows for sideloading third-party apps
Cons: Allows for installing malicious apps
Jailbreaking Techniques:
  Tethered: 
    Device boots normally, may get stuck in partially booted state
    Device must be thethered to computer and rejailbroken each time
    Use BOOT TETHERED feature of a jailbreaking tool
  Semi-Tethered
    Device Boots normally
    If jailbroken functionality is required, device must be tethered to a computer and jailbreaking tool must be used
  Untethered:
    Device will be in a jailbroken state even after reboot
    Doesn't require the help of a computer
    Kernel is now patched over
  Semi-Untethered
    Similar to semi-tethered
    Device boots normally
    Device can be patched without a computer
    Patch is applied by an app on the device
Tools for jailbreaking:
  Hexa/Hexaplus
Hacking tools using an iOS:
  Network-Analyzer Pro
  Fing
  Elcom Phone Breaker - Paid forensic tool
  Spyic cell phone - Parental control app
Hacking methods
  Trust-jacking (remotely read messages/emails/etc, sync with iTunes Wifi Sync over wifi)
  iOS Malware - https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Malware_for_iOS

Security Measures:
  Don't jailbreak your phone
  Use screen lock with one or multiple security measures 
  Don't install 3rd party apps or sideload apps without thorough 
  Don't use random wifi
  Enable location services
  Keep phone updated and patched
  Don't open links with attachments from emails or texts
  Use vpns for sensitive data
  Enable Find my phone
  Use a mobile security suite - trendmicro/mcafee/avast 

	Mobile Device Management (MDM):
MDM - allows for admins to remotely manage mobile devices
Uses:
  Enable authentication, remote wiping, disabling jailbreaking/rooting, POLICY ENFORCEMENT, Inventory/Asset tracking
Examples:
  ManageEngine MDM Plus: Covers android, apple, etc and is cloud based
  IBM MaaS360 with Watson: Cloud provided Mobility as a Service
  Intune: Industry standard MDM
BYOD (Bring your own Device):
  By using company-related (Line of Business) apps, your phone is subject to company security policies/management
  Personal devices must follow device policy
  Pros:
    Convenience, Productivity/Efficiency, Cost Effectiveness (you don't need to buy a work phone/app)
  Risks:
    Supporting multiple types of devices (increased attack surfce), mingling of private and company data, insecure device/data disposal, access unsecure/untrusted networks, phones can be lost or stolen, users can bypass securty policy
BYOD securty Policy
  Define and Formalize requirements
  Standardize technology - hardware/software, approved apps or devices
  Publish and disseminate policy info
  Implement Security:
    Asset and Identity Management
    Local Storage Control
    Removable media controll
    Network access control
    Device password policy
    Web security
    Device Health 
    DLP
    Organization/Personal App control
    Trained support staff and user education

Security Guidelines:
  Always update and patch
  Use antivirus/antispyware
  Keep app installs to a bare minimum
  Be able to securely do remote wipes or deletions
  No jailbreaking/rooting/sideloading
  Have a good securty policy
  Use fully disk encryption
