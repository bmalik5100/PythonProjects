	NetBIOS and SMB Enumeration:
Netbios - Made by windows, shares printers, files, etc, for local computers to communicate over network
  uses UDP/TCP port 137, 139
  nbtstat - windows Netbios tool
  [nbtstat -c] shows cache
  nbtscan - linux netbios tool
  sudo nmap -sV --script nbstat.nse [target] (Also does the same)
SMB - Share files, printers, serial ports, etc. AKA Server Message Block
  uses port 445
  Windows has their own version, linux has samba
  CIFS and SMBv1 fundamentally the same
  commands:
    sudo nmap -A -Pn -p 445 [target]
    sudo nmap --script smb.nse [target]
    smbclient -L //[target ip] (Will show public SMB shares)
    smbclient //[target ip]/[specific share] (may need to druteforce or use blank password)
    enum4linux -S [target ip] ( good for shares)
  If writing says N/A instead of DENIED, maybe try writing anyway

	SNMP Enumeration:
Simple Network Management Protocol - system of communication relaying status info to server, typically used for monitoring system health
On port UDP/161
Information:
  Managers: Basically the servers 
  Agents: procs on the individual device, check into managers 
  Taps: triggered on certain events to alert agents
  Community String: Sort of like a password. Defaults to public, default is read. private community string is r/w access
  Management Information Base: Database, identifies objects by OID
  
Tools:
  onesixtyone [options] [host] [community]
	Can determine hardware, software, etc.
  snmp-check [target ip]
	Has GUI caleld snmpcheck
	Can determine running procs on target OS, established connections, user accounts
  NMAP
	There are scripts
	sudo nmap -sU -p 161 --script [specific script in /usr/share/nmap/scripts] [target]
  snmpwalk -c [community string, usually public] -v[version] [target ip] [optional OID]
    
Good idea to focus on snmpwalk and nmap 

	LDAP Enumeration:
Most common server is Windows AD
Port number: 389, SSL/TLS LDAP is 636
Good for collecting PII, user/group account data
LDAP Administrator:
  Alternative 3rd party tool to Windows LDAP. Can be used by anyone.
  Uses gui
ldapsearch:
  Linux terminal tool
  ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://[ldap server ip] -b '' -s base'(objectclass=*)' 
AD Explorer:
  
Python Libraries:
    ldap3
    Good for ldap customization (one size fits one)
NMAP Script:
    ldap-search

	NTP Enumeration:
Network Time Protocol - Time synchronization tool (UDP port 123)
Maintains time within ~10ms, can attain accuracy of 200 microseconds
Not super useful for data gathering
Try to get ntp to disclose information about peers that it knows about
Tools:
  ntpdate -d [target]
  ntptrace -r [remote target] (often like traceroute but for ntp)
  ntpq (interactive shell)
    > host [target]
    > peers

	NFS Enumeration:
Uses port TCP/UDP 2049
Tools:
  sudo NMAP -A -n -Pn -p 2049 [target ip]
  rpcinfo -p [target]
  showmounts -e [target]
  rpc-scan.py --nfs [host]
Once you find a mountpoint, try to mount it:
  mkdir /tmp/localpoint
  sudo mount.nfs [target]:/mountshare /tmp/localpoint
  cd /tmp/localpoint
Permissions still apply, but looking for data using find command helpful

	SMTP Enumeration:
Good for discovering usernames, account info
Port 25 is standard, you can log in using telnet or netcat
Tools:
  vrfy [email address or username] - can verify if user is valid, also expn, reciept2
  ncat -nv [target ip] 25 (or telnet)
    ehlo bob [or] helo bob
    vrfy [user]
  smtp-user-enum -M [VRFY/EXPN/RCPT] -u [user] (or) -U [filelist of users, try seclists]
  metasploit
    > search smtp aux (searches for auxiliary/scanners)
    > use smtp_enum
    > options 
    > set RHOSTS [target]
  sudo nmap --script -Pn -n smtp-enum-users.nse -p 25 [target] (not to be confused wuth smtp-user-enum)
