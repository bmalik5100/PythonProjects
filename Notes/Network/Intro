	Intro to Network Communications:
Purpose of Networks: Two or more devices connected to communicate and share data/resources
Bounded transmission media (With Cables, faster):
  Copper Cables
  Fiber Optic Cables
Unbounded Transmission Media (Wireless, easier than wiring through infrastructure):
  Wifi
  Cellular Networks
  Bluetooth
Endpoints (Any device with network conenctivity):
  Servers (Web, File, Email)
  Computers
  Mobile Devices
Redistribution Points
  Hubs (For basic signal retransmissions in a network)
  Routers (For directing traffic at the network layer)
  Switches (For managing traffic at the data link layer)
Network topology considerations
  Bus - (Legacy/Obsolete) Linear cable that all devices are connected to. 
  Star - (Common) Networked device with multiple nodes (devices) connected centrally to it
  Ring - (Legacy/In WAN) - Self-healing with dual ring
  Mesh - (Common in WAN/Wireless ad hoc)
  Tree - Top node with lower tiers
  Hybrid - Two or more, often not intentionally built. 
  Choice of topology impacts network scalability, redundancy and maintenace

	Examining Network Standardization:
ISO - International Organization for Standardization
  Develops and publishes international standards for networking, created OSI Model (ISO/IEC 7498-1)
  ISO/IEC 27000 Series (Information Security)
  ISO/IEC 20000 (IT Service MAnagement
  ISO/IEC 11801 (Cabling Standards for Networking)
IANA - Internet Assigned Numbering Authority
  Developed framework for IP address allocation, DNS root zone administration, and port/protocol parameter assignments (under oversight of ICANN)
ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
  Internationally/Globally oversees the functions of IANA and Internet  
IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
  Develops nad coordinates internet standards (TCP/IP), RFSs
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
  Formulates sandards for internet communications, telecom, IT, and power
  IEEE 802.3 - Ethernet standard
  IEEE 802.11 - Wifi Standard
  IEEE 802.15.1 - Bluetooth Standard
  IEEE 802.1Q (Vlan Tagging Protocol)
 
 	TCP/IP and OSI Model:
OSI - Open Systems Interconnection
Layers:
  7 - Application	(Web Browser/Email Client/Apps, DNS, HTTP, SMTP)
  6 - Presentation	(JPEGs/Encryption & Compression, Formatting)
  5 - Session		(Timing, Sync, Maintain Session Communication, Session Handshake)
  4 - Transport		(TCP/UDP)
  3 - Network		(IP Addressing, Routers, BGP, Layer 3 switching)
  2 - Data-Link		(Logical Link Control, MAC addressing, Switches, Frames)
  1 - Physical		(Pysical Assets, Electrical impulses, 1s and 0s)
 
 IP (fka DoD) Model - 
  4 - Application (User interfaces and higher-Level Protocols) <- All covered by programming/developer
  3 - Transport (Same functionality as Network Layer)
  2 - Internet (Layer 3 of OSI)
  1 - Network Interface  (Data-Link and Physical)
  
OSI is more conceptual, IP is more practical

	Encapsulation and Decapsulation
Application Data - Layer 7 (PDU)
Presentation Data - Layer 6 (PDU)
Session - Layer 5 (PDU)
Transport - Layer 4 (PDU - Segments)
Network - Layer 3  (PDU - Packets)
Data-Link - Layer 2 (PDU - Frames - Also contains CRC32 footer for error checking)
Physical - Layer 1 (PDU - Electrical impulses)

BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit - Helps with STP routing
