Differences between GDB and Immunity Debugger
  GFB - You can discover what a program was doing when it crashed
  Immunity Debugger - Python based API - allows for the writing of exploits and analyzation of malware, and reverse engineering of binary files
CIS Benchmark - considered a compliance thing,
SCAP - Security Content Automation Protocol
  Set of interoperable specifications from community for security compliance and vulnerability assessment
Confidence level of the findings of a vulnerability scan
  Timeliness
  Relevance
  Accuracy
RFCs
TAXII - Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information - format through which threat intelligence data is transmitted.
STIX - Structured Threat Information eXpression - standardized language that uses a JSON-based lexicon to express and share threat intelligence information
  
STRIDE - Model for identifying computer security threats developed by Microsoft: 
  Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
When creating an incident commuincation portion of IR plan, designate an internal point of contact for external communication

CVSS Metric Groups
  Base - Exploitability and Impact (the normal ones)
  Temporal:
    Eploit Code Maturity (E) - Undefined (E:X), Unproven that exploit exists (E:U), Proof of concept code (E:P), Functional exploit exists (E:F), High (E:P)
    Remediation Level (RL) - Undefined (RL:X), Official Fix (RL:O), Temporal Fix (RL:T), Workaround (RL:W), Unavailable (RL:U)
    Report Confidence (RC) - Undefined (RC:X), Unknown (RC:U), Reasonable (RC:R), Confirmed (RC:C)
  Environmental:
    Exploitability (MXX, such as MUI, MAV, MAC)
    Impact (MX, such as MC MI MA)
    Impact Subscore: Confidentiality (CR:X) Integrity (IR:X), Availability (AR:X)
Lessons learned phase of incident response is where Root Cause Analysis occurs
Incident Form:
  Used to descibe the icident in detail - record CMOS and HDD info, image archive details, platform info, and the name and contact info of the person who reported the incident
Call/Escalation List:
  Indicate under what circumstance these certain individuals should be contacted to avoid unnecessary alerts.
Chain of Custody Form:
  Indicates who has handled the evidence, when they handled it, and the order in which the handler was in possession of the evidence.
NIST 800-61 provides guidelines for all stages of handling IoCs including collection analysis and application
  Collection/detection - understanding attack vectors, identifying signs of incident, and sources of precursors and indicators
  Analysis - Analysis Process, Incident proper incident prioritization and stakeholder notification process
  Application/containment, eradication and recovery - minimize damage, remove threat and return to normal environment
Sensitivity Levels
  Low - Intended for public use. Unrestricted
  Medium - Intended for internal use only, Sensitive
  High - Confidential/Restricted, can have catastrophic impact on org or individuals
Security Areas/Channels identified by OSSTMM
  Human Security - Security awarness levels and effectiveness of security training in an org
  Physical Security - Access controls, perimieter security, CCTVs, building/facility controls
  Wireless Communication - all wireless communication security
  Telecommunications - non-wireless types of communication such as VoIP and PBX in org
  Data Networks - assesses computer and network seucurity in your org
eDiscovery Guidelines
  Preservation and Collections process:
    Data acquisition phase should be from a live system to include volitile data when possible
    Data acquisition should include both bit-stream imaging and logical backups 
    The chain of custody should be preserved from the data acquisition phase to the presentation phase
    Hashing should be performed when data is aquired, modified and when custody transfer of data occurs
    A consistent process and policy should be documented and followed at all times
    Forensic toolkits should be used
    Data should not be altered in any manner within reason
    Logs both paper and electronic must be maintained
    At least two copies of collected data should be maintained
Stages of Forensic Discovery
  1. Verification - Confirm an incident has occurred
  2. System Description - COllect Detailed Descriptions of thesystems in scope
  3. Evidnce Acquisition - Aquire the relevant data in scope, minimizing data loss in a matter that is legally defensible
  4. Data Analysis - Medial analysis, string/byte search, timeline analysis, and data recovery
  5. Results Reporting - Provide evidence to prove or disprove statement of facts
Stages of eDiscovery
  1. Identification - Verify that triggering event has occurred. Find and assign potential sources of data subject matter experts and other required resources
  2. Preservation and collection - Acquire data in scope
  3. Processing, Review and Analysis - Process and analyze data ensuring that minimal data is lost
  4. Production - Prepare and produce electronically stored information in a format that has been priorly agreed upon
  5. Presentation - Provide evidence to prove or disprove statement of facts
