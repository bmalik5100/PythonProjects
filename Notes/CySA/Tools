	Packet Capture Tools
Wireshark - gui tool, gold standard:
  Capture Filters (Under capture options) vs Display Filters (In top bar)
  Can use logical operators ( && || ! == != )
  Can use filters (ip.add == [ip addr], ip.dst == [destination ip], ip.src == [source ip], tcp.port == [port], tcp.flags.example
TCPDump - cmd line tool, good for scripting:
  -i [interface, or any]
  -c [count]
  -w [file to write]
  -r [pcap to read]
  [arp, tcp, udp, or icmp]
  [port]
  [host [host ip]]
  [dst [destination ip]]
  [src [source ip]]

Log Analysis Tools:
  SIEMs: Security Information and Event Management
    Log Aggregation System - provide/generate alerts based on conditions
    Previously, syslog servers allowed aggregation of multiple device logs remotely
    Auditing: updates, host configuration, user activity
    Compliance/Governance: PCI-DSS NIST, GDPR
    Examples: AlienVault, Splunk, Wazuh
  SOARs: Security Orchestration, Automation and Response
    Integrates with security tools and technologies:
      CTI, SIEM, EDR, Vulnerability Management platforms, etc
    Helps teams: Detect, Prioritize, and respond to Threats 

	Endpoint Detection and Response:
Tool used to detect more sophiscticated Attacks
Utilizes ML, Behavioral Analysis, and Threat Hunting to detect suspicious activity 
  Detects sohpistigated and targeted attacks, and can also alert and block attacks
Difference from Antivirus:
  AV PREVENTS malware from infecting endpoints
  EDR DETECTS and RESPONDS to malware and that bypasses AVs
  Occasionally integrated within a SIEM
Open source EDR: OpenEDR
Methodology:
  Admin typically installs EDR agent:
    1. Agent Monitors and collects data (User/System data)
    2. Agent builds baselines for endpoint
    3. Agent watch for unusual and/or sustem behavior
      Network activity, file access, system changes, data exfiltration, data encryption (aka ransomware), malware analysis, etc
    4. Automated Response and Remediation
    5. Reporting to dashboard, SOC, etc 
    6. (Optional but recommended) Admin manually confirms/investigates

	DNS and IP Reputation Tools:
Reputation over public internet as a whole
DNS Reputation:
  Focused on domain names associated with IPs
  Determies if a domatin name has been associated with suspicious or malicious behavior
    Such as: Spam, Phishing, Malware, etc
IP Reputation:
  Determines if an IP address has been associated with suspicious or malicious behavior
    Such as: Spam, Phishing, Mawlare, etc
Can be used to block access to websites or othe ronline resources associated with the domain
Often used by web filtering and security services to help protect users from accessing potentially harmful websites
WHOIS:
  Can't perform reputation lookup
  BUT you can get information needed to check reputation, such as NameServer
Cisco: https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center
AbuseIPDB: https://abuseipdb.com  

	File Analysis Tools:
AV/EDR systems can typically do this, but are not perfect
strings - built-in Linux tool to discover and print ascii text in files such as executables
  Suspicious strings could be: base64 encoded strings or ip addresses
  Use regex and searching by piping output to less
Hashing - Good for checking file integrity
  Tools could be: md5sum, sha256sum
VirusTotal - online tool to check uploaded binaries or urls against dozens of AVs
  Also has a free API

	Sandboxing Tools:
Sandbox - safe place to run potentially malicious software for dynamic analysis
DIY sandbox - Customizable Virtual Machine
Sandboxing Services:
  Joe Sandbox: Cloud Sandbox tool with free and pro version, create an environment
  Cuckoo Sandbox: Open-source On Prem sandbox

	Email Analysis Tools:
Email is one of the main attack vectors that security professionals have to deal with
Email Headers: Contain data that could point to impersonation (domains, IPs, Reply-To)
Embedded links: Could contain malicious redirects
Attachments: Be aware of file hashing for integrity, or virustotal
SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
  Create a TXT file that is put into DNS service that lists allowed mail servers
  Authentication system used to verify allowed "Sending Email" Servers
    Is this server allowed to send email on behalf of your domain
    Contains trusted IP addresses of mail servers
  > nslookup
  > set type=txt
  > domain.com
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
  Ensures email integrity using Digital signatures to prevent malicious email modificaitons
    Public/Private Keys (Email recipient uses senders public key of sender to validate digital signature)
DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):
  Advertises that the sender domain is using SPF and/or DKIM
  Tells recipient what to do with email that fails those auth methods (Quarantine, Reject, Ignore, Drop)
  dmarcian.com can verify DMARC of domains
  You can use the RFC to create your own DMARC

	UEBA (User Entity Behavior Analysis):
Determining user behavior to generate baselines
Used to detect compromised account creds, can also determine if real users pose a risk
Is a Built-in funciton to many SIEM solutions, such as Splunk, MS Sentinel
Alerts to anomalies to user baselines, such as unusual location/time of logins, systems/apps access by user

	Scripting and Programming:
JSON (Javascript Object Notation): Searializes and structures data for transfer, used commonly in web applications
XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Human Readable Markup Language used by many systems for data exchange, used by SOAP APIs to structure and encode data being exchanged in SOAP messages
Common Languages for Scripting: Python, Powershell, Shell Scripts
Regex - Used for log analysis, file analysis, report generation

	Integrating Tools and Technology into Security Operations:
APIs - very helpful for automation and integration into other applications
Webhooks - like an API, but responder will reach out to a listening requester once something is complete 
Plugins and Addons - in browsers/end-user sotware or security software
Single Plane of Glass - Aggregate a lot of functionality into a single dashboard
