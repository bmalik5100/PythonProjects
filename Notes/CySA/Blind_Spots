CCB - Configuration Control Board
PAM - Privileged Access Management
  Not to be confused with Linux PAM
  An IAM framework that helps enforce PoLP (People who don't need access do not get access)
  Control, audit and monitor ALL privileged identities and activities
  Both service accounts and user accounts
  "Manage" the "access" of "privileged" use
  Root/Admin Domain and Local, SSH, Service Accounts, API keys/secrets, 
  Mandatory key rotation
  Isolate sensitive assets if traffic is not typical
  Enabling MFA is good for PAM
SASE and its components, namely Secure web gateways, SD-WAN, ZTNA, and CASB
  SD-WAN (Software Defined WAN): Optimized and manages network trafic across varios WANs. Intelligently directs traffic based on real-time network conditions, application requirements, and policies. (Networking capabilities) 
  SaaS: The SASE framework is designed to support secure access to SaaS applications, often by integrating with CASBs to enforce security policies and monitor usage of SaaS applications.
  Zero-Trust Network Analysis:
  Secure Web Gateways (SWG): Provide security at the edge of network, enforces internet access policies, and protects users from web-based threats, inspects web traffic to block malicious content and filters access to inappropriate/blocked websites.
  CASB:
    4 Pillars! Visibility, Compliance, Data Security, Threat Protection 
    Visibility: Who/What/When/Where/Why/How are cloud services being used (CASB should be able to monitor and control/audit conditions of cloud services)
    Compliance (Built-in regulatory compliance)
    Data Security (Encryption and DLP)
    Threat Protection (UEBA and Malware Detection/Analysis)
Zero-Trust
  Requests and connections are NEVER Trusted
  MFA 
  A lot of monitoring and analysis with IDS/IPS, UEBA, Traffic Analysis/Geofencing
  Many features are included in a NGFW
  
Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
  Allows for programmatic configuration of a network 
  Centralized way to deal with your network
  Define policies and rules centrally and software communicates it to network devices
  Popular in a cloud environment, can be security minded
Blind Testing - attackers have no prior knowledge about the system, but taget is informed
Reversal Testing - Attackers know about systems, admins are blind
LDAP Injection -
  
Reasons for automation - Namely processes in a security response playbook, and processes that correspond to identified threat models
Active defense vs passive defense
  Passive Defense (preventative) - measure designed to prevent or mitiage attacks before they occur or as they happen
    Monitoring and deteciton, system hardining, preventative measures like firewalls, AVs, encryption, updates
  Active Defense (proactive) - passively defending but also actively engaging with and countering threats, real-time detection, analysis, and response to threats
    Engagement, such as honeypots, and threat intelligence sharing
    Countermeasures, such as actively disrupting or deciving attackers
    Adaptability - Adapting defense based on ongoing threats and new attack techniques
    Real-time response: focuses on immediate response to attack, including automated actions to neutralize threats/mitigate damage
Exploitability vs impact metrics
  Score out of 10.0
  Exploitability:
    Attack Vector (Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical)
    Attack Complexity (Low, High)
    Privileges Required (None, Low, High)
    User Interaction (None, Required)
    Scope (Unchanged, Changed)
  Impact (CIA)
    Confidentiality (High, Low, None)
    Integrity (High, Low, None)
    Avaliability (High, Low, None)
Security baseline scanning
Inhibitors
  MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) - A statement of intent between the participating orgs to work together. Creation of these agreements should include security as well to avoid or include langage for vulnerability remediation necessity
  SLA (Service Level Agreement) - Defines specific responsibilities of the service provider and sets the customer expectations
BUffer overflows
Request for Change (RFC) and Change Control Board (CAB)
OSS TMM (What compliances are recognized, aka legislative like HIPAA, contractual like PCI DSS, and Standards based like ISO 27001)
Perimeter networks vs system isolation (exceptions are not used with perimeter networks)
Difference between operational and managerial controls
  Operational - day-to-day operations and procedures, often involve direct interaction with systems and users ex. Acess controls, training, incident response, etc
  Managerial - concerned with governance, planning and overall management of security, ex policy development, compliance management, 
Difference between SLI and SLO
Edge Discovery
  Discovering and managing the systems that are connected to the edge of a network between interal and external network
Difference between Physical and Local attack vectors (In regards to CVSS Score Metrics) - Physical attacker has to physically touch computer, local user can have keyboard or RDP/SSH access

FSK vs DD
  DD is an imaging tool, could be considered a forensics tool, but does not provide an forensic suite because it only does one thing
  FTK - Forensic Suite Tool
CySA toolkit:
  Preventative - such as IPS, Firewall, AV/AM, WAF
  Collective - network scanners, vulnerability scanners, SIEMs, pcaps, and IDS
  Analytical - vulnerability scanning, monitoring and inception proxy services

  -sT (default; TCP connect scan) 

Attestation of Findings - Proof that appropriate penetration test was completed

eDiscovery Guidelines
  Preservation and Collections process:
    Data acquisition phase should be from a live system to include volitile data when possible
    Data acquisition should include both bit-stream imaging and logical backups 
    The chain of custody should be preserved from the data acquisition phase to the presentation phase
    Hashing should be performed when data is aquired, modified and when custody transfer of data occurs
    A consistent process and policy should be documented and followed at all times
    Forensic toolkits should be used
    Data should not be altered in any manner within reason
    Logs both paper and electronic must be maintained
    At least two copies of collected data should be maintained
Stages of Forensic Discovery
  1. Verification - Confirm an incident has occurred
  2. System Description - COllect Detailed Descriptions of thesystems in scope
  3. Evidnce Acquisition - Aquire the relevant data in scope, minimizing data loss in a matter that is legally defensible
  4. Data Analysis - Medial analysis, string/byte search, timeline analysis, and data recovery
  5. Results Reporting - Provide evidence to prove or disprove statement of facts
Stages of eDiscovery
  1. Identification - Verify that triggering event has occurred. Find and assign potential sources of data subject matter experts and other required resources
  2. Preservation and collection - Acquire data in scope
  3. Processing, Review and Analysis - Process and analyze data ensuring that minimal data is lost
  4. Production - Prepare and produce electronically stored information in a format that has been priorly agreed upon
  5. Presentation - Provide evidence to prove or disprove statement of facts
