	Log Ingestion Concepts:
Time Synchronization: Why is time important to logs and security?
  Some systems require time sync - errors occur when time is off
  Kerberos is very time sensitive
  Security events - If logging is part of a breach, there is a need to establish an accurate timeline
  Timestamps are legally admissable
  NTP/ntpd is used for synchronization
Logging Levels
  Used especially in syslog
  Timestamps are important
  Determines importance/severity of an event
  Most common are:
    Fatal (system/service crash, BSOD)
    ERROR (Something unexpected happened causing functionality issue)
    WARN  (Something unexpected happened but functionality was able to continue)
    INFO  (Standard Logging data, something occured)
    DEBUG (Finely defined data, helps troubleshoot code/issue)
    TRACE (Extremely specific data (stacktrace), used to investigate difficult errors

	Common Operating System Concepts:
Windows Registry (AKA Hive):
  You can break things easily - it is entire configuration of operating system
  Backups are always a good idea
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT - default applications and related configuration information
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Profile of logged-in user (temp dirs, printers, networks, onedrive, etc)
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (AKA HKEY_LM) - Hardware/Software/Security Configuration (most useful for SecOps, SAM is here)
  HKEY_USERS - Config of all users
  HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG - System Startup, Software
System Hardening: Adding security controls to make systems more secure, many guides online
File Structure:
  Config File Locations:
    Windows: C:\Windows\System32
    /etc, /var, /root, /
    /bin /sbin /usr/ /usr/local (for binaries)
System Processes:
  Task Manager
  Procmon
  top/htop
Hardware Architecture:
  x86 - 32 bit archetecture
  amd64 - 84 but architecture
  ARM - SoC like Raspberry Pi

	Common Infrastructure Concepts:
Serverless technology:
  Cloud service - Servers are involved, you don't provision anything
  Combines cloud services that work together, such as AWS lambda, you are charged for usage
Virtualization:
  Utilize unused resources of a system to make virtual machines - Foundation of cloud services
  Type I Hypervisor (AKA Bare Metal) - Hypervisor is directly installed onto machine (instead of onto an OS)
    VMWare, Citrix
  Type II (AKA Hosted) - Hypervisor runs on top of underlying OS
    VMWare Workstation
Containerization:
  More narrow/streamlined VM with all dependencies needed for a specific application/service
  Most common is docker
    docker pull [image]
    docker run -dit --name [name of app] -p [host port]:[contianer port] -v [source files]:[files mapped to container] [image]:[version]
    docker ps
    docker stop [name of app]
    docker rm [name of app]

	Common IAM (Identity & Access Management) Concepts:
Multifactor Authentiction - Software/Hardware is better than SMS
SSO (Single Sign On) - Enables user to login to multiple apps in the SAME domain
Federation (AKA Federated Identity Management):
  Enables user to login to app across MULTIPLE domains (such as sign in using google account)
    Apps and Service Providers authenticate users with help of Identity Providers (IdP)
  Examples: Okta, OpenID Connect, Azure Active Directory
  If attacker gets access to main account, all other accounts are also compromised
PAM (Privileged Access Management):
  Access framework, helps enforce PoLP (Principle of Least Privilege)
  Comprehensive approave to privileged access - control, audit and monitor all privileged identities and activities
  Both human and non human identities - Root/Admin (Domain/local), SSH, Service Accounts, API Keys
  Mandatory key/secrets rotation for privileged access
  Isolate sensitive assets
Passwordless:
  Possession Factors, such as authentication apps/OTPs, biometrics, "magic links"
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB):
  Cloud Services - Gives control over BYOD, Microsoft Apps, Data sharing and Loss Prevention
    Can also do Encryption and Key Management, User and  
  4 Pillars:
    Visibility - Who/What/When/Where are cloud services being used (CASB Should be able to monitor and control
    Compliance - Built-In Regulatory Compliance
    Data Security - Encryption and DLP
    Threat Protection - UEBA () and Malware Detection/Analysis

	Common Encryption Concepts:
PKI - Ability to create and manage certificates for encryption
  You can Create, Issue, Revoke, and Manage certificates
PKI Components:
  CMS (Certificate Management System)
    Creates, stores, distributes, and verifies certificates
  Digital Certificates:
    The actual cert, used to verify entities
  Validation Authority:
    Validates digital certs
    Can be seperate, or done by CMS
    Hosts a CRL (Cert Revocation list) and responds to CRL requests
  Certificate Authority:
    The main engine
    Issues, validates, Revokes and deletes certs
  End Users:
    The consumer - Requests and sometimes manages certs
  Registration Authority:
    Helps support CA, pre-screens cert signing request for initial enrollments and renewals
    Verifies Requester then forwards requests to CA
PKI Process:
  1. Subject Applies for cert from RA (or CA if no RA)
  2. RA processes request (verifies identity  and requests CA to issue cert/key to subject)
  3. CA process request from RA ( Issues Cert/public key to subject and updates VA with subjects info)
  4. User recieves cert and uses it (Communication is signed with cert)
  5. Client queries the VA and ensures that cert is valid
  6. VA verifies the cert
CA services - often are trusted third parties (VeriSign, Digicert, etc)
Self-Signed - Good for inside organizational intranet, bad for public internet
SSL/TLS Inspection:
  Network device can decrypt/re-encrypt traffic
  Device that can inspect traffic to look for sensitive data and/or malicious traffic
    Common feature of NGFW (Next-gen Firewall), Network Tap, etc\
  Adds strong Layer of security

	Protecting Sensitive Data:
DLP - Any kind of unauthorized loss of data:
  Often for the obfuscation of sensitive things
  Microsoft can enable DLP
  If a SSN is in an email, it can obfuscate it or remove it completely
  
  
PII (Personally Identifiable Information:
  Name, SSN, Phone, Email, etc. that can be attributable to a person
  Extremely lucrative
  Encryption, Obfuscation, Network Segmentation
CHD (Cardholder Data):
  Regulatory framework (PCI-DSS - Payment card data)
  Storage is kept to a minimum
  SAD (Sensitive authentication data) is not stored after authentication
  Assess to full displays of PAN and cardholder data is restricted
  Cryptographic keys are securely stored
  

	Common Network Architecture:
On-Prem - Devices that are owned by and located on organization
Cloud - Managed services of resources/network/software over the internet
Hybrid:
  Logically or/and physically segmented
  Limits attacker's ability to laterally move
  Access to critical systems and data are also limited
Zero Trust:
  Never Trust; Always Verify
  Requests and connections are NEVER trusted
  Applies to external AND internal sources and locations 
    Employs a lot of monitoring and analysis - IDS/IPS, UEBA (User Entity Behavior Analysis), Traffic Analysis, geofencing
    Features often are found in NGFW
SASE (Secure Access Secure Edge):
  Combines Software-Defined WAN, SaaS, CASBs, Zero Trust Network Access
SDN (Software-Defined Networking):
  Traditional networking - control plane and data plane
