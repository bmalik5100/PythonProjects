	Threat Actor Types:
Script Kiddies - Unskilled Hackers that often use other peoples code
Insider Threats - A party in an organization that has higher level of trust to data
  Intentional vs Unintentional
Hacktivists - Hacker with the motivation of a larger cause
Organized Crime - Cyber criminal gangs with a highly financial motivation
Nation-State - State-sponsored hackers backed by large governments (Stuxnet)
APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) - Highly skilled and sophisticated, goal is to persist in target for as long as possible
Supply-Chain Threats - Threat actor that targets supply-chain/hardware/security solutions 

	TTP (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures):
Tactics - High level view of attackers goals:
  Some goals can be: Gain system access, deny/disrubt service, establish persistence, steal data
Techniques - Specific Methods and/or tools used to achieve goals:
  Some methods: Malware, DDoS attacks, social engineering, backdoor/RAT
Procedures - Low-level, detailed description of a technique:
  Entire Cyber Kill Chain
  Recon (OSINT, Active/Passive Scanning)
  Access (Exploit vulnerabilities, using stolen creds)
  Lateral Movements (Pass-the-hash, password reuse, misconfigured networked devices)
  Exfiltrating Data (RAT, Backdoor accounts, Communications with C2, stegonography)
  Covering Tracks (Deleting logs/histories, removing created accounts)

	CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) Levels:
Use to gather topical threats
Three Types:
  1. Strategic
    Long-Term Planning
    Focusses on the who and why (Identify potential vulns and threats, and adversarial motives and capabilities)
  2. Tactical 
    Short-Term Planning
    Tailored to specific teams, operations and investigations
    Focusses on TTPs of likely adversaries
    Aides in Threat hunting efforts
  3. Operational
    Focusing on responding to active threat responses
    SIEMs/SOARs, EDRs, IDS/IPS, IOCs,
    Threat-intel feeds (Anomali, Carbon Black, OpenCTI)
Timeliness Levels:
  Historic/Past (LEAST Relevant, Outdated)
  Current/Present (MOST relevant)
  Forcasted/Future (MODERATELY Relevant, Projected/Predicted Intel)
  Indeterminant/Unknown (LIMITED Relevancy, not enough information is known)
Relevancy Levels:
  Low (Too Generic)
  Moderate (Somewhat Generic, still indicative of usefulness)
  High (Specific to your org/systems)
  Very High (Highly Specific, tailored to your org/systems)
Accuracy Levels:
  Low (Incomplete, Outdated, Unverified Sources)
  Moderate (Partially verify, still some uncertaincy of accuracy)
  High (Verified)
  Very High (Extensively Verified, Objective)

	CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligance) Sources:
Open Source & Closed Source
Open Source:

	CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) Sharing:
Benefits: Better security through sharing CTI - 
  Sharing CTI Benefits during
    Incident Response
    Vulnerability Management
    Risk Management
    Security Engineering
    Detection and Monitoring
Sharing Tools:
  STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) Standardized and formalized for sharing
  TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information) Mechanism for sharing STIX and other data.
    HTTPS/RestFul API service used for sharing CTI data
    Models
      Hub and Spoke
      Single Information Repository
      Peer-to-Peer (Mesh network of sharing information)
      Source-Subscriber
      Single info repo - Subscribers pull from repo
  Yara - Good for sharing CTI that hasn't reached AV signatures, create your own "signatures" from malware
  Sigma - Yara or snort, but for log files

	Threat Hunting:
Discovering an assumed threat or breach and finding signs
IoCs (Indicators of Compromise):
  Not IoA indicator of attack
  Attack/breach has already taken place, looking for anything that is related to it
  Such as: File hashing, URLs/IPs/Domain names
Process for obtaining IoCs:
  Collection:
   Logs, Files, Other data (PCAPs, lolbins, emails, registry entries, Scheduled Tasks
  Analysis:
    Reverse Engineering Malicious Binaries (Static Analysis SAST)
    Dynamic Analysis (DAST)
    Memory Dumps
    Strings
    Metadata
  Application:
    Tracking Threats
    Attribution
Focus Areas:
  Configurations/Misconfigurations
  Isolated Networks
  Business Critical Assets and Processes
Active Defence: Wasting the attackers time (Increasing the probability of detection, even baiting attacker into getting detected)
  Fake websites/pages/directories/login portals
  Canary Tokens
    Inciting files/data
    API Keys
    SSH Keys
    Encryption Keys
    Sensitive-looking documents (passwords.txt, financial docs) 

	Process Standardization (Using Automation):
Identification of tasks suitable for automation:
  Repeatable action that does not require human interaction
  High volume tasks
  Digital workflows
  Error-Prone Tasks
  Monotonous Tasks
  Homogenous data
Team coordinzation to manage and facilitate automation:
  1. Set goals
  2. Establish requirements:
       Regulatory Compliance/Secure Coding Practices
  3. Communication and Notifications:
       Scheduled Meetings/Updates
       Red Flag Triggers, Reporting/Escalation expectiations
       Team Education
       Best Practices
       
	Streamlining Operations:
Definition - Making jobs and busiwork much more efficient
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) - Helps automate and respond autmatically
Orchestrating Threat intelligence data: 
  Data enrichment can help: Improves SIEM capabilities by integrating contextual information, such as group membership, geolocation, social media, internal threat intel.
  Better detections, asset risk categorization, and prioritization of alerts
  Threat feed combination (aggregating CTI) 
Minimization of human engagement
  Allows people to focus on difficult tasks, reduce human error, and increase efficiency
