	Communicate Vulnerability Management Reporting:
Identify your audience (Generically, stakeholder is anyone not involved in creating report)
Stakeholders:
  Executives - C-suite, they want high level overview, what are key finding
  Managers/Dept Heads - Tailor the content you are communicating to be relevant
  General Employees - Why we have end-user security training, be non-technical, dos and don'ts
  IT Staff - you can get technical, they need to know data in a way that is meaningful to them
  Development Team - Be highly technical

Reporting Existing Vulnerabilities:
  What was discovered - ensure you communicate what vulnerabilities are an actual risk and what are irrevalent
  What was affected: Hosts, Processes, Software, Network
    Define scope, and classify what is critical

Classifying of Vulnerabilities:
  Risk Score - Impact x Likelihood, mathematical equation
    Internal vs external vulnerabilities
  NIST has IT vulnerabiliity assessment template
  Provide your own interpretation to add meaning to the data you are providing
  Remember non-technical employees - how does this affect them
Prioritizing:
  What to tackle first - Use score of impact and likelihood, as well as remediation difficulty/cost
  Ensure you are mindful of the reasoning - think of budget and reputation impact
Communicating the remediation process:
  Configuration/Change Management
    Identify and Communicate highest impacted system
    Propose changes
    Identify Risks associated by changing/not changing (think of potential downtime)
  Patch Management:
    Identify Impacted systems
    Proposed Updates - gather information about what systems are relevant and what they fix
    What is the reasoning of the patch

	Communicate Incident Response Metrics and KPIs:
KPI - Key Performance Indicators
Metrics - MTTD -> MTTI -> MTTResp -> MTTC -> MTTRem -> MTTRec
MTTD (Mean-time-to-detect), a measurement of the average time from when an incident starts and the time taken to become aware of the vulnerability
MTTI (Mean time to identify)
MTTR (Mean time to respond) - time between inital response to potential incident
MTTC (Mean time to contain) average time to quarantine
MTTR (Mean time to remediate) average time to patch/remove vulnerability
MTTR (Mean time to recover) average time to restore to normal functionality

Alert Volume - amount of notifications indicating a potential security incident. The greater the amount of notifications can leat to "alert fatigue"
	
	Communicating Compliance Reporting:
Could be industry regulation, government regulation, or just SLA/contractual obligation
Know your audience - is the compliance a guideline, standard or framework
Know the industries
  ISO 27001 - Gap analysis - what is the ideal state vs current state of environment
  HIPAA - Healthcare industry
  PCI-DSS - Payment Card Industry
  GDPR - Companies that do business (or have customer information) in EU
  SOC2 - Standard for storage and processing of information
  California Data Privacy Act - Kind of like GDPR for California residents
Accredidation is a very long process
Regulation is a 
Examples of Communication:
  Secure your communication to appropriate stakeholders
  Report compliance requirements and scope, as they often change
  Report on controls providing adherence to requirements 
  Communicate and be aware of compliance vs non-compliance and proposed controls, especially ensure that employees know what is and is not allowed (clean desks, no sharing keycards/privileges, etc)
  Monitoring/Validation - ensure proposed control meets the regulation 
Definitely periodically nurture your policies, anually at least, to audit and report that compliance is followed

	Communicate Inhibitors to Remediation:
MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)
  A statement of intent between organizations to work together and often states goals, objectives, or the purpose for the partnership 
  They always should include security as well to avoid or include language for vulnerability remediation necessity
SLA (Service Level Agreement):
  Defines the specific responsibilities of the service provider and sets the customer expectations
  Creation of these agreements should include a potential for service disruption if an incident happens
Organizational Governance (The execs):
  Senior leadership may not be on board with interruptions
  Overal process from detection to patching can be long and consume a lot of resources
  Compensating controls may be required
  While the remediation process may reduce service levels, it has to be conveyed that it will increase security and reduce risks to the company
Degrading functionality:
  With SLAs in mind, reduced performance or functionality or service quality might put the company a risk of a violation, which can bring penalties
  Vulnerability scanning can consume large amounts of bandwidth
  Can interrupt business processes
Legacy Systems:
  Legacy systems that cannot be patched present a high degree of risk
  Virtually no support
  May be required to support business systems as the cost may be too expensive to upgrade or deploy new software
  May have to implement compensating controls

	Communicate Incident Response Reports:
Identify your stakeholders (anyone not part of the remediation effort that requires communication):
  IT Security Team - Handle the technical aspects of the incident 
    They may have authority to declare an incident. If not them, who else
      Communicate the process in playbooks beforehand - names, positions
    Who handles the response of the incident - names, positions, contact information
      IT engineers, CSIRT, support staff, etc
    Who handles the incident escalation: Communicate process, names, positions
  Executives - they make the key decisions
    Require a higher level view of the incident, the minutiae does not matter
    Commucation requires a summarization of key events
    They may appreciate a failover/disaster recovery plan
  Legal - (local, city, state, federal)
    Work with a legal counsel
    Ensure that the strategy of response is in compliance with regulation or laws, including obligations through contracts (MOU, SLA, Regulatory/Customer Obligations)
  Public Relations:
     Support services, Brand reputation, company reputation
     Customer services (SLAs, not met, breaches, outages)
     Public media
  Regulatory Authority reporting:
    Examples: HIPAA/GDPR violations
  Law Enforcement may be involved during civil or crimminal liabilities
Incident Response Reporting:
  Executive Summary - High level overview of key findings
    Who - threat actor
    What - type of occurence, threat vector, method
    When - Timestamp of the occurrance, maybe downtime, MTTRs
    Where - What system, process, application, or physical location the incident occured
    Why - Identified vulnerability/ies
  Recommendations - strategic advice on controls to implement or deploy (aka countermeasures)
    Consider gap analysis
  Timeline - a complete record of the event from detection to remediation
  Legal Obligations - Chain of custody, timeline, compliance violations, notifications
  Impact - Financial, functional, availability, etc
  Scope - details of the range of the effect to the organization, does it affect venders, customers
  Evidence - preservation of all the documentation for examination at a later time (timestamps, chain of custody, etc)

	Communicating RCA (Root Cause Analysis):
After the confinement and remediation, before you close the incident
Lowest level look at why an incident occurred
You can use the cyber kill chain
RCA:
  Identify the vulnerability and contributing factors
  Clear and consise breakdown of the underlying circumstances and the timeline of events
  Other systems - discovery circumstances can affect other systems, did pivots occur, was there later moves or "jump boxes"
  Deploy strategic controls and countermeasures
    Reduce or limit the impact of other vulnerabilities in case there is another incident
    Avoid reoccurence - who has the authority to say the incident is over
Lessons Learned:
  Incident Response Team and everone involved in recovery should be involve in lessons leaned
  There should be formal sessions, with documentation
  Policy Changes: what went right, what went wrong, where can we improve
  Identify roadblocks or barriers to remediation and recovery
  Identify changes that need to made to the incident response plan
  Identify and document new IoCs (Indicators of Compromise)

	Communicate Vulnerability Metrics and KPIs:
Go to the professionals - look at trend analysis from companies
Gartner Top CS Predictions:
  Responding to threats:
    Attack Surface Expansion (changes to digital system, modern workplaces esp after pandemic)
    Identity Threat Detection and Response (Identity as a new perimeter, sustained attacks)
    Digital Supply Chain Risk (disclosure of sensitive information, compromise of infrastructure, security flaws in products delivered to customers)
  Rethinking technology:
    Vetting Vendors/Vendor Consolidation (Supply chain management strategy()
    Cybersecurity Mesh - a set of tools and controls to secuire a modern enterprise
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities:
  
CVE database from MITRE
Critical Vulnerabilities and zero-days
SLOs (Service Level Objectives):
  Measurable characteristic of an SLA
  Defines best performance levels and the lowest amount of service that is acceptable by an SLA (such as 99.9% uptime)
  Quantifiable metrics that show the reliability of a system
  Should be understood by technical staff and communicated appropriately to leadership
All these attributes must be communicated to the stakeholders: IT Technical teams, Execs, Customers (such as for service interruptions)
