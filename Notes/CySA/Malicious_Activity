	Malicious Network Activity:
Bandwith Consumption - Using behavioral analysis, monitor for anomalies in the network 
Beaconing - Malware has been installed and is trying to reach out to its C2 server
Irregular P2P Communication - (Such as beaconing), looking for repetitiveness 
Rogue Devices on Network - Covered by asset management and discovery
Scans/sweeps - especially by non-admins, and fast, also can catch bruteforce attempts
Unusual Traffic Spikes - Look for ICMP across network. Beware of alert fatigue (and port 4444)
Activity on Unexpected Ports - Close unused ports!
Important to know what your baseline is, so that you are aware of what is unusual.

	Malicious Host Activity:
Resource Consumption - Common indicator of malware:
  Processor
  Memory
  Storage/Drive Capacity
  Network
Unauthorized Activity - Remediate with Asset Management:
eck  Software - Define a policy in your organization
  Changes - Automate auditing policy, such as Group Policy Check?
  Privileges - Use PoLP and prevent privilege creep through Asset management
Malicious Processes - Task Manager or Procmon, If anything looks unusual or unrecognizable
Data Exfiltration - Look at size of data, port, being exfiltrated using monitoring tools, wireshark, IDS, SOC.
Abnormal OS Process Behavior - look at resource consumption, check file hashes, set registry persistence or export it
File System changes or anomalies - Also look at file hashes, unusual directories
Unauthorized Scheduled Tasks - Task Scheduler (Windows) or Crontab (Linux)

	Malicious Application Activity:
Anomalous Application Activity - Look for unusual resource consumption/spiking, asking for admin creds, filling up storage, changing regestry entries
  Ensure you are aware of typical behavior, baselines
Introduction of new accounts - ESPECIALLY new user accounts (occasionally software installation intends to create service accounts)
  Powershell: net-user [user account] (Check local/global group memberships) 
  Linux: cat /etc/passwd, grep "csh\|zsh\|bash" /etc/passwd
Unexpected Output from Applications: Occasional indicator of buffer overflows is "garbled mess"
  Linux: netstat | grep -i established, look for unusual communications
         wireshark, ps, etc
  Powershell: Task Manager, netstat, procmon (cmd or powershell sessions)
Service Interuptions: Look for denial of service, random or consistent service crashes, common with buffer overflows. Look in application/service/error logs 
Application Logs: Look for random heavy entry spikes or unusual activity

	Other Malicious Activity:
Social Engineering Attacks:
  Probably THE most effective type of attack
  Best Defense is good end-user training
  Asking about how IT team is structured, to enumerate admin users
  Physically ask someone to fill out form
  Asking to install software/AVs
  Asking someone to click link from email
  Phishing 
Obfuscated Links:
  Links that have malicious intent hidden from victim
  Hyperlink over text
  Typosquatting (ex. https://outloook.com or lowercase l to uppercase I)
  Encoding some of link (outloook.com/admin/?login=%25%27
  Common attack vector is HR through visiting sites and socials from employees
  URL shorteners, bit.ly, tinyurl, etc (online sites can undo this safely)
