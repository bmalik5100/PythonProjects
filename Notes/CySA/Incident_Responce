	Attack Methodology Frameworks:
Cyber Kill Chain:
  Reconnaissance
  Weaponization
  Delivery
  Exploitation
  Installation (of malware/backdoors)
  Command and Control (C2)
  Actions and Objectives
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
             Infrastructure
    Adversary               Victim
               Capability
MITRE ATT&CK
  Globally accessable knowledgebase of attack techniques
  Useful for the development of specific threat models and penteting guides
  Sort of a more detailed version of the cyber kill chain
OSS TMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
  Assures there is emperical scientific testing for security
OWASP Testing Guide:
  Web Security Testing Guide
    Guide for security testing of web apps/services
DON'T Consult the textbook - Go to the websites, since they are always updated

	Incident Response - Detection and Analysis:
IoCs (Indicators of Compromise):
  Network-Related Indicators:
    Unusual Bandwidth
    Beaconing - periodical ping towards C2
    Irregular P2P communication - Inside to outside of network
    Rogue Network Devices
    Common protocols using non-standard ports
  Host-Related Indicators:
    Unusual or excessive resource consumption 
    Unauthorized Software/Applications
    Modified/bypassed allowlists
    File System changes
    Unauthorized privileges - audit your admins
    Data Exfiltration
    Registry Changes (Windows)
    Unauthorized Scheduled Tasks
  Application-Related Indicators:
    Anomalous activity (does this app always ask for admin?)
    New accounts
    Unexpected Output or Erroring
    Unexpected outbound communication
    Service interruption
    Memory overflow
    Weird activity in application logs
Evidence Acquisitions:
  There must be a clear and well-documented chain of custody.
  Validation of data integrity
  Preservation
  Legal hold - Assets must be preserved and intouched due to legal compliance
Data and log analysis:
  SIEM - Log aggregation system such as splunk that helps manipulate, manage, and analyze logs

	Incident Response - Containment, Eradication and Recovery:
Containment:
  Reduce or eliminate the spread of the incident, includes preserving evidence
  Focus on scope of incident - how much is affected by incident
  Segmentation - including microsegmentation, such as containers, sandboxes, etc
  Isolation - Take host(s) off the network if necessary 
  Removal - Consider threat intelligence value, crime scene evidence, and business continuity 
Eradication:
  Return all systems to a known good state; rebuild systems
  BE SURE TO GATHER EVIDENCE FIRST - memory dumps, file hashes, etc
  Rebuild rather than repair - consider good snapshots or backups,
Recovery:
  Identify the relevant attack vectors and implement countermeasures
  Communicate with teams and departments to determine best way to mitigate vulnerabilities
  Sanitize (through rebuilding)
  Reconstructed of data
  Secure disposal (degaussing, shredding, etc)
  Patching systems
  Fix/audit permissions, make sure any new accounts are deleted

Consider:
  Impact
  Isolation (Think ahead)
  Remediation plan
  Compensating controls (and why they were not enough to stop breach)

	Incident Response - Preparation:
End-User Training! Train employees on procedures that must be followed, incidents that may occur
Develop incident response drill scenarios, blind and non-blind test process
Ensure everything is approved and funded
Preparation (According to NIST):
  Gather tools
  Create playbooks
  Plan for BC/DR (Business Continuity/Distaster Recovery)
  Tabletop workshops

	Incident Response - Post-Incident Activity:
Forensic Analysis Phase:
  Uses legal compliance guidelines
  Also called digital forensics
  Recover data that was unavailable during the incident
Root Cause Analysis:
  As defined by NIST, "A principle-based systems approach for the identification of underlying causes associated with a particular set of risks"
  Oftentimes the incident is a result of targeting multiple vulnerabilities, not just one, so do not be quick to assume
Lessons Learned:
  Often in the form of a report (Comes from the military)
  Typical Format:
    Issue
    Discussion
    Recommendation
  Keep your audience in mind when creating report, do not be too technical with c-suite
