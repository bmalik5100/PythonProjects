Undertand the basics of these standards and frameworks, their purpose, and how they apply to cybersecurity practices.

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
Purpose - Designed to PROTECT CARD INFORMATION during and after a financial transaction
Key Requirements:
  Build and Maintain a Secure Network (Firewalls, IPS/IDS, Security Configurations)
  Protect Cardholder Data (Encrypt cardholder data stored and transmitted)
  Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program (Use and update AV software and develop secure systrems and applications (SAST/DAST))
  Implement Strong Access Control Measures (Restrict access to cardholder data to only those who need it and implement strong authentication mechanisms)
  Monitor and Test Networks (Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data and regularly test security controls)
  Maintain an Information Security Policy (Develop a policy that addresses infosec)

ISO 27001 (International Organization for Standardization)
Purpose - Provides a systematic approach to managing SENSITIVE COMPANY INFORMATION to ENSURE CIA TRIAD
Key Satndard - ISO - Specifies requirements for an information security management system, coverign risk manaement, securit controls, and continuous improvement

SOX (Sarbanes Oxley)
Purpose: To provide accuracy and reliability of financial reporting to companies
Includes requirements for internal controls over financial reporting and the security of electronic records

FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act):
  Role and Purpose - FISMA requires federal agencies and their contractors to secure information systems
  Mandates the development of security policies, risk management processes, and continuous monitoring
  Within the context of government systems

HIPAA (Health insurance portability and accountability act)
  Role and Purpose - US regulation focused on protecting the privacy and security of PHI
  Mandates safeguards to protect electronic PHA including admin, physical and technical controls

NIST provides a broad set of standards guidelines and best practices to help orgs manage and reduce CS risk
NIST Cybersecurit Framework - a set of guidelines for managing cs risk in critical infrastructure
NIST SP 800 - detailed publications covering various aspects of infosec, including risk management, incident response and security controls

NIST provides broad guidance on cyber practices and frameworks
ISO offers international standards for information security management
HIPAA focuses on protecting health information
SOX deals with financial reporting and internal controls
FISMA addresses federal information security requirements
